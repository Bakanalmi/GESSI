abstract={This paper proposes the questions and method to conduct a research intending to promote the first steps towards a better integration between evidence from systematic reviews and software engineering practice. First, we are planning to conduct a tertiary study to identify systematic reviews in software engineering. Second, we intend to investigate how those reviews relate to practitioners' issues reported in a leading software engineering Question & Answer platform. Third, we plan to generate and evaluate Evidence Briefings from those reviews in order to establish a medium to transfer knowledge acquired from systematic reviews to practice. This paper also presents some preliminary results from pilot studies we have been conducting. Â© 2016 ACM.},
