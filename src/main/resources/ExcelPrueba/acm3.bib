abstract = {Software product lines are widely used in the software industries to increase the re-usability and to decrease maintenance cost. On the other hand, systematic reviews are widely used in the software engineering research community to provide the overview of the research field and practitioners guidelines. Researchers have conducted many systematic studies on the different aspects of SPLs. To the best of our knowledge, till now there is no tertiary study conducted on systematic studies of SPL related research topics. In this paper, we aim at conducting a systematic mapping study of existing systematic studies to report the overview of the findings for researchers and practitioners. We performed snowballing and automated search to find out the relevant systematic studies. As a result, we analyzed 60 relevant studies to answer 5 research questions. The main focus of this tertiary study is to highlight the research topics, type of published reviews, active researchers and publication forums. Additionally, we highlight some of the limitations of the systematic studies. The important finding of this study is that the research field is well matured as the systematic studies covered a wide range of research topics. Another important finding is that many studies provided information for practitioners as well as researchers which is a notable improvement in the systematic reviews. However, many studies failed to assess the quality of 
the primary studies which is the major limitation of the existing systematic studies.},

abstract = {Context: The use of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) requires expertise and poses many challenges for novice researchers. The experiences of those who have used this research methodology can benefit novice researchers in effectively dealing with these challenges. Objective: The aim of this study is to record the reported experiences of conducting Systematic Literature Reviews, for the benefit of new researchers. Such a 
review will greatly benefit the researchers wanting to conduct SLR for the very first time. Method: We conducted a tertiary study to gather the experiences published by researchers. Studies that have used the SLR research methodology in software engineering and have implicitly or explicitly reported their experiences are included in this review. Results: Our research has revealed 116 studies relevant to the theme. The data has been extracted by two researchers working independently and conflicts resolved after discussion with third researcher. Findings from these studies highlight Search Strategy, Online Databases, Planning and Data Extraction as the most challenging phases of SLR. Lack of standard terminology in software engineering papers, poor quality of abstracts and problems with search engines are some of the most cited challenges. Conclusion: Further research and guidelines is required to facilitate novice researchers in conducting these phases properly.},

abstract = {Context: Systematic literature reviews and mapping studies usually rely on automated searches of digital libraries to identify primary studies. Defining proper search strings, executing semantically similar searches on different libraries, and reporting limitations of searches increase the reliability of secondary studies. Objective: We aim to survey the current state of using automated searches in secondary software engineering studies. In particular, we aim at analyzing how automated searches are reported and at understanding the reproducibility of secondary studies. Method: We perform a preliminary tertiary study that covers 50 recently published representative secondary studies from different software engineering venues and subfields. Results: We found that most secondary studies complement an automated search with a manual search and use four or 
more digital libraries. Also, we found that the quality of reporting search strings is rather poor. Finally, we found that most secondary studies do not acknowledge limitations of automated searches and implications of limitations on study findings. Conclusions: Our findings highlight implications for researchers (e.g., to properly report the search process) and for reviewers (e.g., to execute search strings reported in papers). Also, 
our findings indicate that secondary studies are difficult to replicate.},
