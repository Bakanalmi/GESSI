abstract={This study aims to examine the systematic literature reviews published on the Agile Software Development subject between 2013 and 2018 
and to examine the citation relationships among the studies within the scope of the tertiary study with the help of social network analysis. In this study, the publications within the scope were visualized with VOSviewer and Gephi social network analysis tools, and the relations between publishing institutions, countries were revealed. In citation analysis; according to the total link strength, it is seen that UK, Spain and Slovenia are at the forefront at institution and country level. Brazil has the highest citation value and provides the link between the two large clusters obtained in the analysis. In the bibliographic coupling analysis, the five 
most active countries at the country level were Brazil, Germany, Finland, 
Malaysia and Pakistan. When the same analysis is made at the institution level, the top five institutions are in Brazil, Switzerland, Peru and Pakistan. The findings of the study indicate that developing countries have more studies on the subject and that the cited publications are mostly from developed countries; European countries seem to be more collaborative based on citation analysis yet developing countries such as Brazil and Malaysia have also relations with them; the number of publications is not directly proportional to the citations.},

abstract={The combination of blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) brings revolutionary changes to Industry 4.0. However, blockchain technology is immature now and the combination is under exploration. To understand 
the research status of applying blockchain-based solutions for IoT, we conduct a tertiary study that systematically reviews secondary studies in this domain. Through the processes of automated search and selection, this 
study obtains 11 secondary studies published between 2016 and 2020. Based 
on the rigorous data extraction and analysis, we have established a comprehensive overview of the current state, concerns, and critical findings of relevant studies focusing on blockchain-based solutions for IoT. Results involve typical challenges and characteristics of blockchain itself, the constrained nature of IoT, and specific domains that blockchain-based solutions are commonly applied to. Three directions are also highlighted for future research, i.e. addressing challenging quality attributes, consensus optimization, and integrating blockchain-based IoT with other new technologies.},

abstract={There has been an increasing interest in conducting Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) among Requirements Engineering (RE) researchers in recent years. However, so far there have been no tertiary studies conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of these published SLR in RE. 
In this paper we present a tertiary study of SLR that focus solely on RE related topics by following the guidelines of Evidence Based Software Engineering. We have conducted both automated search of major online sources 
and manual search of the RE and SLR related conferences and journals. Our 
tertiary study has identified 53 distinct systematic reviews published from 2006 to 2014 and reported in 64 publications. We have assessed the resulting SLR for their quality, and coverage of specific RE related topics thus identifying some gaps. We have observed that the quality of SLR in RE has been decreasing over the recent years. There is a strong need to replicate some of these SLR to increase the reliability of their results for future RE research.},

abstract={In this paper we present preliminary findings from a tertiary 
study on global software engineering. In particular, we observe current trends in the software engineering research and perform an investigation of the role of agile topics in the GSE research literature. Our findings indicate that agility is one of the topics attracting attention in the research agenda for global software companies. In contrast to recent beliefs 
that agile and distributed are two incompatibilities Global Agile development becomes more and more accepted, a trend which we also see from the growing amount of research on GSE and agile. Finally we conclude that there are indications that both globalization and "agilization" of software companies are stable trends for the future but that there is a strong need 
for further studies on the particular challenges that distribution of work imposes on the principles of agile development.},

abstract={Distributed Software Development (DSD) emerged from the need to achieve geographically distant customers and currently, allows organizations have global customers and other benefits. This scenario has given rise to new Software Engineering challenges resulting from DSD particularities. Several Systematic Reviews were conducted to address these new challenges. The objective of this paper is to categorize systematic reviews conducted in DSD context. We used the systematic review method to identify SLRs (Systematic Literature Reviews) that address DSD aspects. This study is categorized as a tertiary review. Of fourteen SLRs, seven address aspects of managing distributed development. Four SLRs addressed topics of 
engineering process. The three remaining are related to Requirements, Design and Software Engineering Education in DSD. The topic areas covered by 
SLRs are limited, where the majority are focused on summarize the current 
knowledge concerning a research question. Despite the number of SLRs, the 
amount of empirical studies is relatively small.},

abstract={Software Effort Estimation is key to the success of any project since all downstream activities such as planning, budgeting, developing and Monitoring cannot be executed without clarity on the scope of the activity that needs to be performed. This is a tertiary study that follows 
the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process as put forth by Kitchenham 
in her seminal paper, based on five criteria: estimation technique, estimation accuracy, type of dataset and independent variables used in empirical research on effort estimation. Our study covering 820 Primary Studies through 14 SLRs, shows that Software Effort Estimation studies focus more 
on statistical techniques and Machine Learning is taking precedence in comparison to the others; whereas Expert Judgement is preferred by the industry due to its intuitiveness. There is a need for models that are simple 
to understand and global, due to the distributed nature of software development. The studies are inconclusive about the accuracy benefits of using 
a within company dataset vs.external datasets. Machine learning techniques such FL and GA in combination with Analogy methods generate more accurate estimates. There is increasing consensus on the use of Mean Magnitude of Relative Error (MMRE), Median Magnitude of Relative Error (MdMRE) and Prediction Pred (25%) as the accuracy metric. 78% of the Primary Studies reported accuracy using MMRE. The best MMRE reported is in the range of 7 
to 75. ISBSG (International Software Benchmarking Standards Group) and Desharnais datasets with 27% and 17% usage respectively are the most widely 
used datasets in empirical studies on effort estimation. Fewer than 20 independent variables account for more than 90% impact of variables in empirical analysis on Software effort estimation.},

abstract={Background: In recent years, studies involving Grey Literature (GL) have been growing and attracting the attention of researchers in software engineering (SE). One of the sources of GL refers to content produced by professionals based on their practical experiences? Recent researches in the SE states that GL can complement areas of research that are not yet clearly defined in the scientific literature. In this context, the 
Multivocal Literature Review (MLR), a form of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) with the inclusion of GL, emerges. Goal: Provide preliminary work 
about the current research involving MLR studies? First, we investigate the motivation of the researchers to include GL in review studies; and second, we examine how GL was included in the studies. Method: A tertiary study was conducted to search MLR studies published between 2009 to April of 2019. Results: The main motivations for including GL in review studies are: lack of academic research on the topic, emerging research on this topic, and complementary evidence in the GL? Internet articles and white papers were the main sources of GL data used. Conclusions: The conducting of MLR studies is still in its early stages; we have identified only 12 secondary studies. The MLR studies were conducted using guidelines for performing SLRs. What we consider to be a threat to the validity of these studies, since guidelines to conduct SLR studies do not provide recommendations for quality analysis and synthesis of primary studies, including GL.},

abstract={Context: There has been an increase in research into global software development (GSD) and in the number of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) addressing this topic. Objective: The aim of this research is to catalogue GSD SLRs in order to identify the topics covered, the active 
researchers, the publication vehicles, and to assess the quality of the SLRs identified. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs dealing with GSD. We differentiate between SLR studies and papers reporting those studies. Data relating to each of the following was extracted and synthesized from each study: authors and their affiliation at the time of publication, the journal or conference in which the paper was published, the quality of each study and the main GSD study topic. Results: Twenty-four GSD SLR studies and 37 papers reporting those studies were identified. Major GSD topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, and (3) project planning and control. The main research groups are based in Brazil (17), Ireland (8), and Sweden (7). Conclusions: GSD SLR studies are most frequently reported in the International 
Conference on Global Software Engineering and IEEE Software; the two most 
popular topics for research are risk factors due to the organizational environment and the development process. The most active researchers are based in Brazil. The quality of the SLR studies has not changed over time.},

pages={36226-36243},
abstract={Context: The inclusion of grey literature (GL) is important to remove publication bias while gathering available evidence regarding a certain topic. The number of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) in Software Engineering (SE) is increasing but we do not know about the extent of GL usage in these SLRs. Moreover, Google Scholar is rapidly becoming a search engine of choice for many researchers but the extent to which it can find the primary studies is not known. Objective: This tertiary study is an attempt to i) measure the usage of GL in SLRs in SE. Furthermore this study proposes strategies for categorizing GL and a quality checklist to use for GL in future SLRs; ii) explore if it is feasible to use only Google Scholar for finding scholarly articles for academic research. Method: We have conducted a systematic mapping study to measure the extent of GL usage in SE SLRs as well as to measure the feasibility of finding primary studies using Google Scholar. Results and conclusions: a) Grey Literature: 76.09% SLRs (105 out of 138) in SE have included one or more GL studies as primary studies. Among total primary studies across all SLRs (6307), 582 are classified as GL, making the frequency of GL citing as 9.23%. 
The intensity of GL use indicate that each SLR contains 5 primary studies 
on average (total intensity of GL use being 5.54). The ranking of GL tells us that conference papers are the most used form 43.3% followed by technical reports 28.52%. Universities, research institutes, labs and scientific societies together make up 67.7% of GL used, indicating that these are useful sources for searching GL. We additionally propose strategies for 
categorizing GL and criteria for evaluating GL quality, which can become a basis for more detailed guidelines for including GL in future SLRs. b) Google Scholar Results: The results show that Google Scholar was able to retrieve 96% of primary studies of these SLRs. Most of the primary studies that were not found using Google Scholar were from grey sources.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become an emerging and increasingly essential area of research, given the prospects of increasing the elderly world population. The establishment of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm provided several advances in the field of healthcare for older adults. However, the development of AAL platforms focused on older adults is still presenting several challenges. Many of these challenges are 
similar to those existing for IoT architectures (i.e., interoperability) and others are derived from the healthcare domain (e.g., patients and caregivers as end-users). In this paper, we present a survey of secondary studies on AAL platforms published between 2013 to 2017. Our focus resided in investigating the state-of-the-art of the adaptive AAL platforms for older adults assistance. We have established a set of research questions with which we seek to gain an overview of AAL platforms, development patterns, and the main challenges in this domain. We describe our search protocol, the execution, the selection of the papers, and the results obtained. Among the conclusions of our overview, we can mention the absence of a reference architecture for AAL platforms and some open questions (e.g., 
data privacy, usability, accessibility) present in this domain.},

This first (important) step can be made significantly easier if the researcher can employ a more systematic way to extract the maximum of the literature on the topic. Objective: Essentially, the objective of this preliminary study is to rank three freely available academic 
search engines (Google Scholar, DBLP, Microsoft Academic Search) on the basis of the indexed Software Engineering academic literature they contain. Method: We have used a systematic mapping to conduct the study. Results: After extracting and analyzing 1067 secondary studies (from 18 tertiary studies), we have concluded that Google Scholar has indexed 98.96%, DBLP has indexed 93.43%, and Microsoft Academic Search engine has indexed 97.46% of the secondary studies. Thus, this implies that Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search might be a better-suited option for searching

There are many and different technological solutions that aim to help these individuals learn and execute daily activities. The literature presents a large number 
of papers describing technologies for autism; however, given the volume of primary and secondary studies, it is difficult to have an overview of the existing solutions and gaps to deal with in future researches. Based on this problem, a literature systematic mapping on review studies about technologies to people with autism was carried out. A total of 33 literature review studies (which analyzed 1298 primary studies) were examined. We 
categorized these studies according to their area, the support offered, the skill to be developed, the user's development phase, and the kind of technology used. Furthermore, we have also organized the research questions that were already covered in studies and their future works. This will help researchers to identify topics and challenges to be explored by new research.},

abstract={Futureintech is funded by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise as 
one of a range of initiatives to significantly lift enrolments in tertiary study in technology, engineering and science over the medium to long-term. Begun in 2003, Futureintech is an initiative of The Institution of Professional Engineers, New Zealand. Futureintech works directly with schools and industries to help ensure that technology, maths and science teachers have the right resources to inform students and inspire them to continue their study through to tertiary level. The approach is hands-on. Nine 
Facilitators work to engage industry support, and work with classroom teachers, careers advisors, students and their caregivers, within primary, intermediate and secondary schools throughout New Zealand. Futureintech Ambassadors play a major role as industry role models. Ambassadors are young technologists, scientists, and engineers who are trained as volunteers to work in classrooms alongside teachers and students to support the curriculum. Currently 235 are involved in a variety of initiatives throughout 
the country, assisting with projects, helping students work towards national qualifications, facilitating individual and class access to workplaces and offering personal contributions to career evenings. Futureintech works in close partnership with a wide range of organisations including the 
Royal Society of New Zealand, the New Zealand Institute of Food Science and Technology, and the New Zealand Computer Society and helps co-ordinate 
and promote science and technology- based educational schemes such as CREST, Bright Sparks and the Transpower Neighbourhood Engineers Awards. Futureintech Ambassadors mentor students involved in these projects, offering 
them an industry perspective. Futureintech also strongly supports Ministry of Education initiatives in the field, particularly the Growth and Innovation Framework Technology Education initiative to promote and support technology education at senior secondary. In Futureintech's Visiting Industry Professionals (VIP) Scheme, technology, engineering and science professionals are hosted by a university or polytechnic for up to three weeks. 
The aim of the Scheme is to encourage ongoing partnerships between tertiary institutions and technology- based industries, and to raise awareness of specific industry environments, areas of growth and career opportunities. Futureintech's website, www.futureintech.org.nz, is a key promotional 
tool for careers in technology, engineering and science, and a resource base for teachers, careers advisors, caregivers and students. Futureintech 
has also published a range of promotional material, including booklets targeting caregivers, and posters and brochures for classroom use, and regularly contributes articles to youth magazines, community newspapers and other media. The Project is monitored and evaluated by researchers at the University of Auckland and anecdotal evidence to date strongly suggests that the Project's approach is successful. All respondents rated Futureintech positively as a general initiative for supporting careers in technology, engineering and science in New Zealand. Monitoring and evaluation is in its final phase and will focus on continuing to gain a mix of quantitative and qualitative data from a range of sources to establish the impact 
of Futureintech within different sectors. The remaining three months will 
also focus on collecting post intervention data from case study schools.},

One of the methods that has been widely used to support evidence-based practices is the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method. The SLR is a review method that aims to provide unbiased or fair evaluation to existing research evidence. The aim of this study is to gather the trends of evidence-based software engineering (SE) research in Malaysia in particular to identify the usage of SLR method among researchers, academics or practitioners. Based on our tertiary study, we found only 19 published work utilizing evidence-based practices in Malaysia within SE and Computer Science related domains. We have also conducted a survey during SLR workshops for the purpose of gathering perceptions on using SLR. The survey was participated by 78 academics and researchers from five universities in Malaysia. Our findings 
show that researchers in this country are still at preliminary stage in practicing evidence-based approach. We believe that knowledge and skill on 
using SLR should be promoted to encourage more researchers to apply it in 
their research.},

abstract={Software startups play an important role to foster innovation, economic growth, and job creation in a region. Startups are likely to increase their odds of thriving if they are embedded in a startup ecosystem. Actors of an ecosystem cocreate value, share resources, and support the prosperous evolution of peers. In recent years, software startups have been the focus of intensive research by the software engineering community. In this paper, we conducted a tertiary study to synthesise literature in the field of requirements engineering in startups. We concluded that there are limited empirical studies reporting an in-depth contextual analysis on how software startups perform requirements engineering. In parallel, we conducted a case study of startups based at Digital Port ecosystem. 
Our empirical results confirm what has been presented by literature that startups adopt requirements practices in a flexible and informal manner. In fact, as novel empirical evidence, we observed that even as startups evolve by acquiring the first paying customers and growing the customer base, requirements practices remain very pragmatic. Our results also reveal 
how actors of the studied ecosystem interact to support the co-evolution of startups.},

abstract={Context: The assessment of Threats to Validity (TTVs) is critical to secure the quality of empirical studies in Software Engineering (SE). In the recent decade, Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was becoming an increasingly important empirical research method in SE. One of the mechanisms of insuring the level of scientific value in the findings of an 
SLR is to rigorously assess its validity. Hence, it is necessary to realize the status quo and issues of TTVs of SLRs in SE. Objective: This study 
aims to investigate the-state-of-the-practice of TTVs of the SLRs published in SE, and further support SE researchers to improve the assessment and strategies against TTVs in order to increase the quality of SLRs in SE. 
Method: We conducted a tertiary study by reviewing the SLRs in SE that report the assessment of TTVs. Results: We identified 316 SLRs published from 2004 to the first half of 2015, in which TTVs are discussed. The issues associated to TTVs were also summarized and categorized. Conclusion: The common TTVs related to SLR research, such as internal validity and reliability, were thoroughly discussed in most SLRs. The threats to construct 
validity and external validity drew less attention. Moreover, there are few strategies and tactics being reported to cope with the various TTVs.},

abstract={This study aims to compare the use of targeted manual searches with broad automated searches, and to assess the importance of grey literature and breadth of search on the outcomes of SLRs. We used a participant-observer multi-case embedded case study. Our two cases were a tertiary study of systematic literature reviews published between January 2004 and June 2007 based on a manual search of selected journals and conferences and a replication of that study based on a broad automated search. Broad searches find more papers than restricted searches, but the papers may be of poor quality. Researchers undertaking SLRs may be justified in using targeted manual searches if they intend to omit low quality papers; if publication bias is not an issue; or if they are assessing research trends in research methodologies.},
