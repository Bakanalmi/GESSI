abstract = {Context: The use of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) requires expertise and poses many challenges for novice researchers. The experiences of those who have used this research methodology can benefit novice researchers in effectively dealing with these challenges. Objective: The aim of this study is to record the reported experiences of conducting Systematic Literature Reviews, for the benefit of new researchers. Such a 
review will greatly benefit the researchers wanting to conduct SLR for the very first time. Method: We conducted a tertiary study to gather the experiences published by researchers. Studies that have used the SLR research methodology in software engineering and have implicitly or explicitly reported their experiences are included in this review. Results: Our research has revealed 116 studies relevant to the theme. The data has been extracted by two researchers working independently and conflicts resolved after discussion with third researcher. Findings from these studies highlight Search Strategy, Online Databases, Planning and Data Extraction as the most challenging phases of SLR. Lack of standard terminology in software engineering papers, poor quality of abstracts and problems with search engines are some of the most cited challenges. Conclusion: Further research and guidelines is required to facilitate novice researchers in conducting these phases properly.},

abstract = {Context. The large-scale use of microservices and their increasing adoption in the industry in recent years has motivated researches 
on the most diverse aspects related to microservice-based development. However, as it is a relatively new topic, there is still no consolidated body of knowledge in the area. Objective. The present work intends to investigate the current state of research on microservices based on the formulation of six research questions covering fundamental aspects, such as: main interest topics and adopted standards, techniques and tools have been used and application areas. Method. From four digital libraries, 22 secondary studies were selected as a data source, which were analyzed and synthesized in the present study following the proposed research protocol. Results. Among the main topics of interest addressed, we highlight researches related to the applicability of microservice architecture, both by industry and academia. Results indicated that standards focus on challenges related to communication have been the most commonly considered by researchers of the area. Finally, the predominance in the use of the Docker container and the presence of DevOps practices in the automation of operations are noteworthy. Conclusions. The present mapping study points to some directions of research based on the identified gaps, such as modeling and 
testing of microservice applications, and addressing security aspects. Another promising point to be explored involves the combined use of microservice architecture with other related concepts such as IoT, smart cities, 
FOG computing and reactive systems, in order to reinforce the use of microservices, as well as creating new solutions and challenges to be researched.},

abstract = {Software product lines are widely used in the software industries to increase the re-usability and to decrease maintenance cost. On the other hand, systematic reviews are widely used in the software engineering research community to provide the overview of the research field and practitioners guidelines. Researchers have conducted many systematic studies on the different aspects of SPLs. To the best of our knowledge, till now there is no tertiary study conducted on systematic studies of SPL related research topics. In this paper, we aim at conducting a systematic mapping study of existing systematic studies to report the overview of the findings for researchers and practitioners. We performed snowballing and automated search to find out the relevant systematic studies. As a result, we analyzed 60 relevant studies to answer 5 research questions. The main focus of this tertiary study is to highlight the research topics, type of published reviews, active researchers and publication forums. Additionally, we highlight some of the limitations of the systematic studies. The important finding of this study is that the research field is well matured as the systematic studies covered a wide range of research topics. Another important finding is that many studies provided information for practitioners as well as researchers which is a notable improvement in the systematic reviews. However, many studies failed to assess the quality of 
the primary studies which is the major limitation of the existing systematic studies.},

abstract = {Context: The quality of an Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is as good as the quality of the reviewed papers. Hence, it is vital to rigorously assess the papers included in an SLR. There has been no tertiary study aimed at reporting the state of the practice of quality assessment used in SLRs in Software Engineering (SE).Objective: We aimed to study the practices of quality assessment of the papers included in SLRs in SE.Method: We conducted a tertiary study of the SLRs that have performed quality assessment of the reviewed papers.Results: We identified and analyzed different aspects of the quality assessment of the papers included in 127 SLRs.Conclusion: Researchers use a variety of strategies for quality assessment of the papers reviewed, but report little about the justification for the used criteria. The focus is creditability but not relevance 
aspect of the papers. Appropriate guidelines are required for devising quality assessment strategies.},
