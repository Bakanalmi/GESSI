abstract={This paper unfolds the ongoing fourth revolution of supply chains (4SC) and proposes guidelines for future research. The review of sixty-five literature reviews follows three stages: bibliometric analysis of 
Industry 4.0, its synergies with supply chain transformation, and state-of-the-art assessment. 4SC is a context-bound technological change driven by organizational and cultural priorities, aiming to create more sustainable networks to serve the customers and support responsible decisions in the supply lifecycle. The proposed framework can assist future literature 
reviews and digital transformation proposals for 4SC that need to frame their context and incorporate functions to endure change. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Literature reviews can provide evidence of the scientific results obtained from preliminary studies. However, in a secondary review, information regarding current limitations and future research directions that are necessary for continuous improvement in a field of study can remain scattered. To extract in-depth information on unmanned aircraft system 
(UAS) applications, particularly in civil engineering areas, including construction, infrastructure operation, and environmental areas, an evidence-based tertiary review was conducted. A systematic tertiary review using 
the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) method was performed based on 33 secondary review articles published between 2011 and 2019. The results documented a total of seven limitations and four future research directions. This paper highlights the need for further studies addressing human and UAS interaction concepts, potential risk analysis in UAS flights, and objective performance assessment. This review indicates that increased levels of autonomy, safety, and efficiency of UAS applications are highly recommended to enhance the capability of UAS applications. This work contributes to providing the comprehensive argument on UAS applications in the civil engineering field, and to documenting future directions of UAS research for both practitioners and academics working in the area. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Context: Quality Assessment (QA) of reviewed literature is paramount to a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as the quality of conclusions completely depends on the quality of selected literature. A number of researchers in Software Engineering (SE) have developed a variety of QA 
instruments and also reported their challenges. We previously conducted a 
tertiary study on SLRs with QA from 2004 to 2013, and reported the findings in 2015. Objective: With the widespread use of SLRs in SE and the increasing adoption of QA in these SLRs in recent years, it is necessary to empirically investigate whether the previous conclusions are still valid and whether there are new insights to the subject in question using a larger and a more up-to-date SLR set. More importantly, we aim to depict a clear picture of QA used in SLRs in SE by aggregating and distilling good practices, including the commonly used QA instruments as well as the major 
roles and aspects of QA in research. Method: An extended tertiary study was conducted with the newly collected SLRs from 2014 to 2018 and the original SLRs from 2004 to 2013 to systematically review the QA used by SLRs in SE during the 15-year period from 2004 to 2018. In addition, this extended study also compared and contrasted the findings of the previous study conducted in 2015. Results: A total of 241 SLRs between 2004 and 2018 were included, from which we identified a number of QA instruments. These instruments are generally designed to focus on the rationality of study design, the rigor of study execution and analysis, and the credibility and 
contribution of study findings and conclusions, with the emphasis largely 
placed on its rigor. The quality data is mainly used for literature selection or as evidence to support conclusions. Conclusions: QA has received much attention in SE in more recent years and the improvement is evident since the last study in 2015. New findings show that the aims are more concise, the instruments are more diverse and rigorous, and the criteria are more thoughtful. © 2020},

abstract={Context. The large-scale use of microservices and their increasing adoption in the industry in recent years has motivated researches on the most diverse aspects related to microservice-based development. However, as it is a relatively new topic, there is still no consolidated body of knowledge in the area. Objective. The present work intends to investigate the current state of research on microservices based on the formulation of six research questions covering fundamental aspects, such as: main interest topics and adopted standards, techniques and tools have been used and application areas. Method. From four digital libraries, 22 secondary studies were selected as a data source, which were analyzed and synthesized in the present study following the proposed research protocol. Results. Among the main topics of interest addressed, we highlight researches related to the applicability of microservice architecture, both by industry and academia. Results indicated that standards focus on challenges related to communication have been the most commonly considered by researchers of the area. Finally, the predominance in the use of the Docker container and the presence of DevOps practices in the automation of operations are noteworthy. Conclusions. The present mapping study points to some directions of research based on the identified gaps, such as modeling and testing of microservice applications, and addressing security aspects. Another promising point to be explored involves the combined use of microservice architecture with other related concepts such as IoT, smart cities, 
FOG computing and reactive systems, in order to reinforce the use of microservices, as well as creating new solutions and challenges to be researched. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={Context: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) rely on a rigorous and auditable methodology for minimizing biases and ensuring reliability. A common kind of bias arises when selecting studies using a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria. This bias can be decreased through dual revision, which makes the selection process more time-consuming and remains prone to generating bias depending on how each researcher interprets the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Objective: To reduce the bias and time spent 
in the study selection process, this paper presents a process for selecting studies based on the use of Cohen's Kappa statistic. We have defined an iterative process based on the use of this statistic during which the criteria are refined until obtain almost perfect agreement (k>0.8). At this point, the two researchers interpret the selection criteria in the same 
way, and thus, the bias is reduced. Starting from this agreement, dual review can be eliminated; consequently, the time spent is drastically shortened. Method: The feasibility of this iterative process for selecting studies is demonstrated through a tertiary study in the area of software engineering on works that were published from 2005 to 2018. Results: The time saved in the study selection process was 28% (for 152 studies) and if the number of studies is sufficiently large, the time saved tend asymptotically to 50%. Conclusions: Researchers and students may take advantage of 
this iterative process for selecting studies when conducting SLRs to reduce bias in the interpretation of inclusion and exclusion criteria. It is especially useful for research with few resources. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This longitudinal study concerns the analysis of 347 doctoral 
theses on scientific medical information retrieved from the TESEO database and defended in Spanish universities from 1977 to 2018. At the same time, it considers other factors, such as the geographical scope distinguishing between dissertations defended in the Spanish region of Levante and in the rest of Spain, and discusses the gender of the authors and whether the general scientometric topic is eminently bibliometric or just related 
to the computerisation process. The longitudinal global finding is a bimodal trend rejecting the Price model of science growth. Our study reveals that this production came initially from the universities located in the Spanish Levante. Despite the recent increase of theses covering computerisation topics, the theses on scientific medical information are mostly bibliometric. In addition, men were more productive than women but no statistically significant differences in the quantity and in the longitudinal trends according to the authors’ gender were observed. Nevertheless, women show a growing lineal pattern. An overall conclusion that could 
be inferred is that the prestige gained by the Spanish scientific medical 
information is the result, to a considerable extent, of the remarkable efforts performed by its researchers. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={Software startups play an important role to foster innovation, economic growth, and job creation in a region. Startups are likely to increase their odds of thriving if they are embedded in a startup ecosystem. Actors of an ecosystem cocreate value, share resources, and support the prosperous evolution of peers. In recent years, software startups have been the focus of intensive research by the software engineering community. In this paper, we conducted a tertiary study to synthesise literature in the field of requirements engineering in startups. We concluded that there are limited empirical studies reporting an in-depth contextual analysis on how software startups perform requirements engineering. In parallel, we conducted a case study of startups based at Digital Port ecosystem. 
Our empirical results confirm what has been presented by literature that startups adopt requirements practices in a flexible and informal manner. In fact, as novel empirical evidence, we observed that even as startups evolve by acquiring the first paying customers and growing the customer base, requirements practices remain very pragmatic. Our results also reveal 
how actors of the studied ecosystem interact to support the co-evolution of startups. © 2020 IEEE.},

lack of integration spanning these individual frameworks can be observed. 
In this conceptual paper, we hypothesize that reconfigurability can be considered such an integral perspective that consolidates the research in SC adaptation to ever changing environments. We theorize a new notion – a Reconfigurable SC or the X-network–that exhibits some 
crucial design and control characteristics for complex value-adding systems in highly vulnerable environments. We support our argumentation and conceptual viewpoints by a literature analysis along with tertiary studies to review and structure contextual factors of designing the X-networks. We propose respective frameworks and discuss the implementation principles 
and technologies at the macro and micro levels. Two novel concepts–dynamic SC meta-structures and dynamic autonomous services–are introduced. Distinctively, we go beyond the existing knowledge to predict proactively the future directions in the reconfigurable SCs. Our results can be of value for decision-makers to decipher chances and barriers in contemporary SC transformations. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Context: The term System of Systems (SoS) has increasingly been used in a wide variety of domains to describe those systems composed of independent constituent systems that collaborate towards a mission that 
they could not accomplish on their own. There is a significant volume of research by the software architecture community that aims to overcome the 
challenges involved in architecting SoS, as evidenced by the number of secondary studies in the field published so far. However, the boundaries of 
such research do not seem to be well defined, at least partially, due to the emergence of SoS-adjacent areas of interest like the Internet of Things.Objective: This paper aims to investigate the current state of research on SoS architecting by synthesizing the demographic data, assessing the 
quality and the coverage of architecting activities and software quality attributes by the research, and distilling a concept map that reflects a community-wide understanding of the concept of SoS. Method: We conduct what is, to the best of our understanding, the first tertiary study on SoS architecting. Such tertiary study was based on five research questions, and was performed by following the guidelines of Kitchenham et al. In all, 
19 secondary studies were evaluated, which is comparable to other tertiary studies. Results: The study illustrates a state of disconnection in the 
research community, with research gaps in the coverage of particular phases and quality attributes. Furthermore, a more effective approach in classifying systems as SoS is required, as the means of resolving conceptual and terminological overlaps with the related domains. Conclusions: Despite the amount of research in the area of SoS architecting, more coordinated and systematic targeted efforts are required in order to address the identified issues with the current state of research. © 2019},

abstract={The low performance of software projects generally arises from erroneous, omitted, misinterpreted, or conflicting requirements. To produce better quality specifications the practise of requirements reuse through requirement patterns has been widely debated in the secondary literature. However, a tertiary study that provides an overview of secondary studies on the state of the art and the practise of requirement patterns does not exist. This study describes a study of secondary literature on requirement patterns under a perspective on research and practise. The identification and selection methods of secondary studies include automatic search on five sources, inclusion, and exclusion criteria, the snowballing technique, and the quality assessment of those studies. Four secondary studies are considered relevant according to the purpose of this research from a 26-distinct-study group. The authors' contribution is two-fold: the

The majority of papers reported the usage of points, badges, and leaderboards as game elements in software engineering process, software engineering methods and tools, and software engineering management. Although secondary studies reported a positive impact of gamification, more 
empirical research is required. In a nutshell, current research focuses on the feasibility of using gamification in different SE areas; however, there is a need for research of application context and for defining variables under study to carry out more sound empirical research. © 2020,

abstract={Background: The adoption of the evidence-based research paradigm by software engineering researchers has created a growing knowledge base provided by the outcomes from systematic reviews. Aim: We set out to identify and catalogue a sample of the knowledge provided by systematic reviews, to determine what support they can provide for an evidence-informed approach to teaching about software engineering practice. Method: We undertook a tertiary study (a mapping study of systematic reviews) covering the period to the end of 2015. We identified and catalogued those reviews that had findings or made recommendations that were considered relevant to teaching about industry practice. Results: We examined a sample of 276 systematic reviews, selecting 49 for which we could clearly identify practice-oriented findings and recommendations that were supported by the data analysis provided in the review. We have classified these against established software engineering education knowledge categories and discuss 
the extent and forms of knowledge provided for each category. Conclusion: 
While systematic reviews can provide knowledge that can inform teaching about practice, relatively few systematic reviews present the outcomes in a form suitable for this purpose. Using a suitable format for presenting a summary of outcomes could improve this. Additionally, the increasing number of published systematic reviews suggests that there is a need for greater coordination regarding the cataloguing of their findings and recommendations. © 2020 Wroclaw University of Science and Technology.

abstract={A systematic literature review (SLR) is an empirical method used to provide an overview of existing knowledge and to aggregate evidence within a domain. For computer science, several threats to the completeness of such reviews have been identified, leading to recommendations and guidelines on how to improve their quality. However, few studies address to what extent researchers can replicate an SLR. To conduct a replication, researchers have to first understand how the set of primary studies has 
been identified in the original study, and can ideally retrieve the same set when following the reported protocol. In this article, we focus on this initial step of a replication and report a two-fold empirical study: Initially, we performed a tertiary study using a sample of SLRs in computer science and identified what information that is needed to replicate the 
searches is reported. Based on the results, we conducted a descriptive, multi-case study on digital libraries to investigate to what extent these allow replications. The results reveal two threats to replications of SLRs: First, while researchers have improved the quality of their reports, relevant details are still missing—we refer to a reporting threat. 
Second, we found that some digital libraries are inconsistent in their query results—we refer to a searching threat. While researchers conducting a review can only overcome the first threat and the second may not be an issue for all kinds of replications, researchers should be aware of both threats when conducting, reviewing, and building on SLRs. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Context: The inclusion of grey literature (GL) is important to remove publication bias while gathering available evidence regarding a certain topic. The number of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) in Software Engineering (SE) is increasing but we do not know about the extent of GL usage in these SLRs. Moreover, Google Scholar is rapidly becoming a search engine of choice for many researchers but the extent to which it can find the primary studies is not known. Objective: This tertiary study is an attempt to i) measure the usage of GL in SLRs in SE. Furthermore this study proposes strategies for categorizing GL and a quality checklist to use for GL in future SLRs; ii) explore if it is feasible to use only Google Scholar for finding scholarly articles for academic research. Method: We have conducted a systematic mapping study to measure the extent of GL usage in SE SLRs as well as to measure the feasibility of finding primary studies using Google Scholar. Results and conclusions: a) Grey Literature: 76.09% SLRs (105 out of 138) in SE have included one or more GL studies as primary studies. Among total primary studies across all SLRs (6307), 582 are classified as GL, making the frequency of GL citing as 9.23%. 
The intensity of GL use indicate that each SLR contains 5 primary studies 
on average (total intensity of GL use being 5.54). The ranking of GL tells us that conference papers are the most used form 43.3% followed by technical reports 28.52%. Universities, research institutes, labs and scientific societies together make up 67.7% of GL used, indicating that these are useful sources for searching GL. We additionally propose strategies for 
categorizing GL and criteria for evaluating GL quality, which can become a basis for more detailed guidelines for including GL in future SLRs. b) Google Scholar Results: The results show that Google Scholar was able to retrieve 96% of primary studies of these SLRs. Most of the primary studies that were not found using Google Scholar were from grey sources. ©

abstract={Aim/Purpose We aimed to investigate the circumstances under which Kahoot! (a Game-based Student Response System (GSRS) increases junior and senior Information Sci-ence university students' learning and knowledge retention beyond that of tradi-tional teaching methods. We also explored whether the positive learning impacts of Kahoot! vary as a function of student subject knowledge (i.e., junior vs senior students). Background The effectiveness of game-based student response systems (GSRSs) as learning tools in the classroom remains unclear, given inconsistent findings 
across educa-tional research. Kahoot! enhances secondary and tertiary students' attention and motivation during class, but its effectiveness on learning and retention of course knowledge may vary depending on situational and individual factors. In New Zealand universities, students spend three years studying towards a Bachelor's degree, majoring in subject(s) of their choice. By the end of their third year of study, students are eligible to graduate with a sound knowledge of their chosen major. Thus, first-year students (referred to as "junior students") and third-year students 
("senior students") may differ in terms of their learning styles and their ability and willingness to integrate Kahoot! use into their course work 
and revi-sion. It is hypothesised that differences in subject knowledge between junior ver-sus senior students will influence the perceived effectiveness of Kahoot!. Methodology Thirteen first-year (junior) and fourteen 
third-year (senior) Information Science students (total n = 27), who used Kahoot! in seven lectures (for 30 minutes per lecture) were interviewed about their perception of Kahoot!'s effectiveness. We conducted a mixed-methods case study of students' interview transcripts, demo-graphic records and student scores, where thematic (content) analysis was used to analyse interview responses. Then, we quantified themes for a one-way ANCOVA, with student subject knowledge predicting Kahoot!'s effectiveness, when 
controlling for students' duration of tertiary study and study habits (i.e., hours dedicated to course work per week) as potential confounders. Contribution This study addresses the conflict in existing literature around whether GSRSs improve student learning beyond traditional teaching methods. To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows GSRSs (namely Kahoot!) use im-proves, or at least, supplements tertiary students' learning and knowledge reten-tion of lecture content. This study also reveals how student characteristics (i.e., accumulated tertiary experience) and their subject knowledge influence the effec-tiveness of Kahoot! as a learning tool. Findings Kahoot!'s use increased students' learning and knowledge retention, among other positive impacts (e.g., attention and engagement). However, the perceived learning impact of Kahoot! was greater for senior students. Senior students found Kahoot! more useful for learning new knowledge and revising previously acquired knowledge. On the other hand, while junior students also experienced positive learning impacts using Kahoot!, they reported concerns regarding lim-ited and shallow content coverage, and the time-consuming and distracting na-ture of the platform. Recommendations for Practitioners Educators should take care to ensure GSRSs are appropriately implemented to support rather than replace traditional teaching methods (e.g., "chalk and talk" style presentations, PowerPoint use). In addition, lecturers using GSRSs should clearly inform students about the examinable content and their expectations for performance in formal assessments. Recommendations for Researchers The positive impact of Kahoot! use on students' learning and knowledge reten-tion may be due to stronger interactions and engagement during class. Research-ers should more closely explore how student-lecturer interactions and in-depth discussions following GSRS use influence learning. Thus, there is a need to re-evaluate Malone's (1980) intrinsic motivation theory in relation to the "interac-tive" or "enjoyability" components experienced during Kahoot! use. Impact on Society The positive impacts of Kahoot! use on student learning 
vary for junior and sen-ior students. However, our findings indicate that 
both cohorts of students bene-fit from 15-minute Kahoot! sessions at the end of a lecture or course unit, allow-ing them to test their knowledge and revise* previously taught material. Kahoot! provides a comfortable platform that allows students to ask and answer ques-tions without embarrassment. More experienced students can also evaluate their learning by creating their own Kahoot! quizzes and providing feedback to the lecturers. Overall, Kahoot! use could have a positive impact on teaching and learning globally. Future Research Beyond the recommendation for researchers above, future research should ex-plore how differences in lecturers' teaching styles and students' self-regulation of learning impact Kahoot!'s effectiveness as a learning tool. © Informing Science Institute.},

abstract={Researchers use systematic literature reviews (SLRs) to synthesize existing evidence regarding a research topic. While being an important means to condense knowledge, conducting an SLR requires a large amount of time and effort. Consequently, researchers have proposed semi-automatic techniques to support different stages of the review process. Two of the most time-consuming tasks are (1) to select primary studies and (2) to assess their quality. In this article, we report an SLR in which we identify, discuss, and synthesize existing techniques of the software-engineering domain that aim to semi-automate these two tasks. Instead of solely 
providing statistics, we discuss these techniques in detail and compare them, aiming to improve our understanding of supported and unsupported activities. To this end, we identified eight primary studies that report unique techniques that have been published between 2007 and 2016. Most of these techniques rely on text mining and can be beneficial for researchers, 
but an independent validation using real SLRs is missing for most of them. Moreover, the results indicate the necessity of developing more reliable techniques, providing access to their implementations, and extending their scope to further activities to facilitate the selection and quality

abstract={Context: The reuse of software has been a research topic for more than 50 years. Throughout that time, many approaches, tools and proposed techniques have reached maturity. However, it is not yet a widespread practice and some issues need to be further investigated. The latest study on software reuse trends dates back to 2005 and we think that it should be updated. Objective: To identify the current trends in software reuse research. Method: A tertiary study based on systematic secondary studies published up to July 2018. Results: We identified 4,423 works related to software reuse, from which 3,102 were filtered by selection criteria and quality assessment to produce a final set of 56 relevant studies. We identified 30 current research topics and 127 proposals for future work, grouped into three broad categories: Software Product Lines, Other reuse approaches and General reuse topics. Conclusions: Frequently reported topics include: Requirements and Testing in the category of Lifecycle phases for Software Product Lines, and Systematic reuse for decision making in the category of General Reuse. The most mentioned future work proposals were Requirements, and Evolution and Variability management for Software Product Lines, and Systematic reuse for decision making. The identified trends, based on future work proposals, demonstrate that software reuse is still an interesting area for research. Researchers can use these trends as 
a guide to lead their future projects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: A large number of systematic reviews (SRs) studies have been performed in the cloud computing field, demonstrating miscellaneous outcomes and utilizing different approaches. Accordingly, a meta-review of cloud SRs is needed to appraise the results of such studies and create an integrated understanding. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A tertiary study was conducted using a systematic method to analyze SRs including two stages: searching and screening 
the SRs and thematic synthesis of results. As a qualitative data management tool, Nvivo software was used to support the research process, for data coding and synthesis. Findings: First, by searching electronic sources between the year of 2011–2016, out of a total of 142 identified articles, 94 articles were included according to pre-determined criteria, of which 76 articles were approved after qualitative evaluation. In the second stage, identifying the research themes, a map of the concepts and issues related to each theme was drawn up. The analysis shows that the quality of articles has improved but can be further enhanced using methodological guidelines as well as supporting tools. The research has focused more on the technical aspect, although there is an equal demand for synthesizing of cloud governance concepts. Originality/value: This is the first tertiary study which presents the main research themes and concepts of cloud SRs in form of thematic maps by using the thematic synthesis and SR methods. This paper also provides some recommendations to improve reviews after evaluating the quality of papers. This study can support reviewers for future SRs in the field and also helps practitioners and managers to have a better understanding of different aspects of cloud computing. ©

abstract={Background: In recent years, studies involving Grey Literature (GL) have been growing and attracting the attention of researchers in software engineering (SE). One of the sources of GL refers to content produced by professionals based on their practical experiences? Recent researches in the SE states that GL can complement areas of research that are not yet clearly defined in the scientific literature. In this context, the 
Multivocal Literature Review (MLR), a form of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) with the inclusion of GL, emerges. Goal: Provide preliminary work 
about the current research involving MLR studies? First, we investigate the motivation of the researchers to include GL in review studies; and second, we examine how GL was included in the studies. Method: A tertiary study was conducted to search MLR studies published between 2009 to April of 2019. Results: The main motivations for including GL in review studies are: lack of academic research on the topic, emerging research on this topic, and complementary evidence in the GL? Internet articles and white papers were the main sources of GL data used. Conclusions: The conducting of MLR studies is still in its early stages; we have identified only 12 secondary studies. The MLR studies were conducted using guidelines for performing SLRs. What we consider to be a threat to the validity of these studies, since guidelines to conduct SLR studies do not provide recommendations for quality analysis and synthesis of primary studies, including GL. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Over the last 30 years, supply chain sustainability has become one of the most dynamic and prolific decision management research fields. The volume of primary and secondary research articles continues to increase yearly with the introduction of emerging topics, new modeling and theoretical approaches, and multidisciplinary perspectives. Motivated by this body of literature, this study reviews key supply chain management concepts, sustainability perspectives, and methodological literature review 
features to support the systematic review of 198 surveys published between 1995 and 2018. The objective is to answer three research questions: which are the existent literature reviews on supply chain sustainability, what are their methodological features, and what are their main objectives and subject matters. Following a content analysis, the study maps and assesses the source material according to analytic categories pertaining to methodological and content features. The study shows that systematic literature reviews are becoming the standard method to conduct literature reviews on sustainable supply chain. However, frequently reviews fall short of meeting, and reporting the methodological rigor required by the systematic method. Although most reviews identified adopt a triple bottom line outlook on sustainability, social aspects continue to be underrepresented, namely in comparison with the environmental factor. This tertiary study 
renders a comprehensive critical survey of the current status of research 
on supply chain sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the last years the interest in developing research on integration of usability and agile software development has been increasing. The number of systematic literature reviews, systematic mapping studies and non-systematic reviews, related to this thematic has also increased. Nevertheless, there is no analysis on the quality of these published secondary studies, nor is there a consolidated research that brings the answer 
of how to integrate these two areas. The goal of this paper is to categorize secondary studies related to the integration of usability and agile software development and present a critical analysis on the quality of the 
selected studies. To accomplish this goal a tertiary study was performed to categorize the related studies selected. Initially 3,065 papers were identified and further narrowed to 14 by applying exclusion criteria and analysis. We classified the selected studies as systematic literature reviews, systematic mapping studies and non-systematic literature reviews to report the data analysis. As a result of this study different forms to integrate usability and agile software development were detected as well as 
the various challenges that must be overcome for the integration success. 
Six main categories were identified to represent ways of integrating usability into agile development: processes, techniques, practices, recommendations, principles and different approaches. Regarding to the challenges for the integration seven main categories were also identified: issues related to tests, time, work balance, modularization, feedback, prioritization, and documentation. Although the interest in researching the integration of usability and agile software development has increased in the last 
years, mostly of the analyzed studies neglected the quality criteria and presented difficulties to use methods to synthetize the research results. 
Despite this, it has been realized that the integration of usability with 
agile software development is possible and is strongly aligned with user-centered design. The initial studies indicated a separation of activities 
and roles into specific tracks with parallel work to treat usability in agile software development, but the trend is no longer to manage and control these activities in separate ways, so new challenges are becoming to appear. Although we have identified several points of tension, the integration does not become unfeasible. © 2018},

abstract={Context: Data synthesis is one of the most significant tasks in Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Software Engineering (SE) researchers have adopted a variety of methods of synthesizing data that originated in other disciplines. One of the qualitative data synthesis methods is meta-ethnography, which is being used in SE SLRs. Objective: We aim at studying the adoption of meta-ethnography in SE SLRs in order to understand 
how this method has been used in SE. Method: We conducted a tertiary study of the use of meta-ethnography by reviewing sixteen SLRs. We carried out an empirical inquiry by integrating SLR and confirmatory email survey. Results: There is a general lack of knowledge, or even awareness, of different aspects of meta-ethnography and/or how to apply it. Conclusion: There is a need of investment in gaining in-depth knowledge and skills of correctly applying meta-ethnography in order to increase the quality and reliability of the findings generated from SE SLRs. Our study reveals that meta-ethnography is a suitable method to SE research. We discuss challenges and propose recommendations of adopting meta-ethnography in SE. Our effort also offers a preliminary checklist of the systematic considerations 
for doing meta-ethnography in SE and improving the quality of meta-ethnographic research in SE. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Beyond K-12 education, there is a need to better address the learning methodologies of students to enable them to become independent self-directed problem solvers upon their graduation from tertiary studies. 
In this work, the preliminary studies and results for using a self-directed learning (SDL) approach for project-based learning (PBL) in the area of Information Technology is presented. Coupled with the adoption of interrelated dimensions of competency, the proposed work captures the learning 
journey including (1) the transition from pure software implementation of 
enacted scenarios to hands-on problem solving on the hardware equipment, and (2) the challenges and benefits of adapting this framework to expand the disposition components to achieve SDL. With the changes, students can 
reap the benefits of being more independent in solving realistic and situational problem practically, which will be advantageous for them upon joining the workforce. Early results from the implementation show positive responses from students in finding the SDL approach to be useful and suggest possible extension of its usage to other related areas of study. ©

It has been shown that socio-economic standing has a significant impact on retention of engineering students as well as on achievements attained in their course. For universities in South Africa to remain relevant students need to be able to succeed in their tertiary studies. Although there will always be students who do not succeed and are not retained it is important to assist students who start their tertiary education at a disadvantage. Theoretically the range of achievements acquired should be similar for students from all walks of life as their range of potential is similar. By exposing students to short narratives from senior students describing their personal experience; from feeling insecure and not coping to gaining a sense of coping with the academic and social demands of the university, and in this way the achievement gap is reduced. These narratives aim to give students realistic expectations with regard to their academic careers. © 2019 IEEE.},

Objectives: We synthesize SMSs in SE to provide insights into existing SE areas and to investigate the trends and quality of SMSs. Methodology: We use Systematic Literature Review protocol to analyze and map the SMSs in SE, till August 2017, to SE Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Results: We analyze 210 SMSs and results show that: (1) Software design and construction are most active areas in SE; (2) Some areas lack SMSs, including mathematical foundations, software configuration management, and SE tools; (3) The quality of SMSs is improving with time; (4) SMSs in journals have higher quality than SMSs in conferences and are cited more often; (5) Low quality in SMSs can be attributed to a lack of quality assessment in SMSs 
and not reporting information about the primary studies. Conclusion: There is a potential for more SMSs in some SE areas. A number of SMSs do not provide the required information for an SMS, which leads to a low quality 
score. © 2018},

The field of SPLs and variability have been topics of extensive research over the few past decades. Objective: This research characterizes systematic reviews (SRs) in the field, studies how SRs analyze and use evidence-based results, and identifies how variability is modeled. 
Method: We conducted a tertiary study as a form of systematic review. Results: 86 SRs were included. SRs have become a widely adopted methodology covering the field broadly otherwise except for variability realization. Numerous variability models exist that cover different development artifacts, but the evidence is insufficient in quantity and immature, and we argue for better evidence. SRs perform well in searching and selecting studies and presenting data. However, their analysis and use of the quality of and evidence in the primary studies often remains shallow, merely presenting of what kinds of evidence exist. Conclusions: There is a need for actionable, context-sensitive, and evaluated solutions rather than novel ones. Different kinds of SRs (SLRs and Maps) need to be better distinguished, and evidence and quality need to be better used in the resulting syntheses. © 2018},

identify: (a) the trend of reporting threats to validity, (b) the most common threats to validity and corresponding mitigation actions, and (c) possible categories in which threats to validity can be classified. Method: 
To achieve this goal we employ the tertiary study research method that is 
used for synthesizing knowledge from existing secondary studies. In particular, we collected data from more than 100 studies, published until December 2016 in top quality software engineering venues (both journals and conference). Results: Our results suggest that in recent years, secondary studies are more likely to report their threats to validity. However, the 
presentation of such threats is rather ad hoc, e.g., the same threat may be presented with a different name, or under a different category. To alleviate this problem, we propose a classification schema for reporting threats to validity and possible mitigation actions. Both the classification 
of threats and the associated mitigation actions have been validated by an empirical study, i.e., Delphi rounds with experts. Conclusion: Based on 
the proposed schema, we provide a checklist, which authors of secondary studies can use for identifying and categorizing threats to validity and corresponding mitigation actions, while readers of secondary studies can use the checklist for assessing the validity of the reported results. ©

abstract={Systematic reviews, as a prime example of evidence-based research, have been able to play a critical role in promoting the scientific level and the growth of cloud market. So far, many systematic reviews have been published in the field of cloud computing, but the fundamental issue is whether these researches are based on a precise process, with a full focus on the issues and challenges of cloud computing, and also have consistent results, or not? Accordingly, in response to this challenge, this research intends to identify, evaluate and synthesize systematic reviews in the field of cloud computing from the methodological and contextual perspectives by conducting a tertiary study for the first time. A systematic review method covering two main steps was used to conduct the research. In the first step, after searching the popular digital libraries between 2011 and 2016, 94 articles were included based on specific criteria. Finally, after qualitative evaluation, 76 papers were qualified using a specific tool. In the second step, based on the thematic synthesis, two main research themes including technology and business in the field of cloud 
computing were identified and finally, mapping of the concepts and issues 
related to each area were drawn up and validated using a three-step Delphi method consisting of 12 experts. From the methodological point of view, 
results of this study showed that over recent years the number and quality of review articles have increased, as well as the use of guidance references and software tools can facilitate the research process. From the contextual perspective, the study also found that the review research has been focused more on technical aspects including cloud security challenges, providing scalable cloud infrastructure according to service levels agreements, and increasing interoperability between services to reduce dependency on cloud vendors. Finally, the study described the need for more review research focusing on business and governance issues of the cloud. © 2019 Iranian Research Institute for Scientific Information and Documentation.

abstract={Lot-sizing has an increased attention in recent years. In the 
area of production planning and control, this trend has given rise to the 
development of lot-sizing models that considers sustainability issues besides the optimization of total operational cost. The study is based on tertiary study that is ensured to analyze the total work have been published. The research was conducted by the definition of appropriate keywords for understanding sustainability issues and ergonomics as a social component in lot-sizing. The paper at hand attempts to understand the development of sustainability issues in lot-sizing and ergonomics as a social component in lot-sizing. We observe that studies focusing on all three dimensions of sustainability are comparatively scarce. However, only a few of the studies have been covered the social sustainability aspect. It is observed that studies addressing ergonomics issues are scarce, and more focus is required on the social sustainability impacts along the supply chain and lot-sizing. Most of ergonomic assessment covered relaxation allowance and energy expenditure rate, OWAS, NIOSH and another consideration about ergonomic lot-sizing is the motion types investigated by authors which were picking, storing as a lifting and carrying motions and did not covered 
pushing, pulling, bending and other hand motions which have positive relationship with work related musculoskeletal disorders. Finally, we propose 
future directions to extend research on the ergonomics in lot-sizing. © 2019 Budapest University of Technology and Economics. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={The paper considers how an existing software system, TractIt Education, originally designed to track skill acquisition, can be modified in order to meet demands of professions that view education as needing to go beyond skills to address professional dispositions. Data on skill acquisition can inform decisions and support student progress in professional education. The paper describes how the software system TrackIt Education is designed and being used to track skill acquisition through tertiary study and into professional employment. However, some professional groups are critical of a focus on skills in education. In particular, many in 
Initial Teacher Education (ITE) view dispositions as being of greater value for teaching professionals than skills, and are attempting to make these dispositions the focus of their developmental efforts. Dispositions and their place in ITE are discussed along with problems with how they are currently applied: the concept of dispositions remains poorly defined and 
there is little agreement on which dispositions are truly important to professional teachers. Research into dispositions typically involves descriptions of approaches taken by various ITE institutions, with little effort made to link dispositions to teacher effectiveness or student outcomes. 
The paper argues that problems with definitions need to be resolved in order for progress in this important field of research. Further, problems with application can be resolved by viewing dispositions as broadly equivalent to competencies as defined in seminal business literature: underlying characteristics of people that are empirically linked to skills and performance. The paper considers how adoption of this definition can inform the way that skills data can be gathered in the field of Education, and used in gathering the data needed to support sound identification of dispositions and their use in professional development. The paper considers how the TrackIt Education system could be modified to make this empirical research into dispositions possible. © 2019 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

abstract={Context: The concept of technical debt (TD) contextualizes problems faced during software evolution considering the tasks that are not 
carried out adequately during its development. Currently, it is common to 
associate any impediment related to the software product and its development process to the definition of TD. This can bring confusion and ambiguity in the use of the term. Besides, due to the increasing amount of work in the area, it is difficult to have a comprehensive view of the plethora 
of proposals on TD management. Objective: This paper intends to investigate the current state of research on TD by identifying what research topics have been considered, organizing research directions and practical knowledge that has already been defined, identifying the known types of TD, and organizing what activities, strategies and tools have been proposed to 
support the management of TD. Method: A tertiary study was performed based on a set of five research questions. In total, 13 secondary studies, dated from 2012 to March 2018, were evaluated. Results: The results of this 
tertiary study are beneficial for both practitioners and researchers. We evolved a taxonomy of TD types, identified a list of situations in which debt items can be found in software projects, and organized a map representing the state of the art of activities, strategies and tools to support 
TD management. Besides, we also summarized some research directions and practical knowledge, and identified the research topics that have been more considered in secondary studies. Conclusion: This tertiary study revisited the TD landscape. Its results can help to identify points that still require further investigation in TD research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become an emerging and increasingly essential area of research, given the prospects of increasing the elderly world population. The establishment of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm provided several advances in the field of healthcare for older adults. However, the development of AAL platforms focused on older adults is still presenting several challenges. Many of these challenges are 
similar to those existing for IoT architectures (i.e., interoperability) and others are derived from the healthcare domain (e.g., patients and caregivers as end-users). In this paper, we present a survey of secondary studies on AAL platforms published between 2013 to 2017. Our focus resided in investigating the state-of-the-art of the adaptive AAL platforms for older adults assistance. We have established a set of research questions with which we seek to gain an overview of AAL platforms, development patterns, and the main challenges in this domain. We describe our search protocol, the execution, the selection of the papers, and the results obtained. Among the conclusions of our overview, we can mention the absence of a reference architecture for AAL platforms and some open questions (e.g., 
data privacy, usability, accessibility) present in this domain. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Context: Systematic literature reviews and mapping studies usually rely on automated searches of digital libraries to identify primary 
studies. Defining proper search strings, executing semantically similar searches on different libraries, and reporting limitations of searches increase the reliability of secondary studies. Objective: We aim to survey the current state of using automated searches in secondary software engineering studies. In particular, we aim at analyzing how automated searches are reported and at understanding the reproducibility of secondary studies. Method: We perform a preliminary tertiary study that covers 50 recently published representative secondary studies from different software engineering venues and subfields. Results: We found that most secondary studies complement an automated search with a manual search and use four or more digital libraries. Also, we found that the quality of reporting search 
strings is rather poor. Finally, we found that most secondary studies do not acknowledge limitations of automated searches and implications of limitations on study findings. Conclusions: Our findings highlight implications for researchers (e.g., to properly report the search process) and for 
reviewers (e.g., to execute search strings reported in papers). Also, our 
findings indicate that secondary studies are difficult to replicate. ©

abstract={Context: Many of the systematic reviews published in software 
engineering are related to research or methodological issues and hence are unlikely to be of direct benefit to practitioners or teachers. Those that are relevant to practice and teaching need to be presented in a form that makes their findings usable with minimum interpretation. Objective: We have examined a sample of the many systematic reviews that have been published over a period of six years, in order to assess how well these are 
reported and identify useful lessons about how this might be done. Method: We undertook a tertiary study, performing a systematic review of systematic reviews. Our study found 178 systematic reviews published in a set of major software engineering journals over the period 2010–2015. Of these, 37 provided recommendations or conclusions of relevance to education and/or practice and we used the DARE criteria as well as other attributes related to the systematic review process to analyse how well they were reported. Results: We have derived a set of 12 ‘lessons’ that could help authors with reporting the outcomes of a systematic review in software engineering. We also provide an associated checklist for use by journal and conference referees.

abstract={Context Systematic reviews can provide useful knowledge for software engineering practice, by aggregating and synthesising empirical studies related to a specific topic. Objective We sought to assess how far 
the findings of systematic reviews addressing practice-oriented topics have been derived from empirical studies that were performed in industry or 
that used industry data. Method We drew upon and augmented the data obtained from a tertiary study that performed a systematic review of systematic reviews published in the period up to the end of 2015, seeking to identify those with findings that are relevant for teaching and practice. For the supplementary analysis reported here, we then examined the profiles of the primary studies as reported in each systematic review. Results We identified 48 systematic reviews as candidates for further analysis. The many differences that arise between systematic reviews, together with the incompleteness of reporting for these, mean that our counts should be treated as indicative rather than definitive. However, even when allowing for problems of classification, the findings from the majority of these systematic reviews were predominantly derived from using primary studies conducted in industry. There was also an emphasis upon the use of case studies, and a number of the systematic reviews also made some use of weaker ‘experience’ or even ‘opinion’ papers. Conclusions Primary studies from industry play an important role as inputs to systematic reviews. Using more rigorous industry-based primary studies can give greater authority to the findings of the systematic reviews, and should help with the creation of a corpus of sound empirical data to support evidence-informed decisions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

period 1996–2016.Results: We found that the two most studied areas of MBT are UML models and Transition-based notations. We also found that only 5 studies compared and classified MBT tools. The main challenges and limitations found were related to the need for more empirical evidence 
that supports the selection of MBT approaches and tools. Conclusions: Not 
many systematic reviews on MBT were found, consequently some areas still lack secondary studies: Test execution aspects, language types, model dynamics, and some model paradigms and generation methods. We thus encourage 
the MBT community to perform further systematic reviews and mapping studies, following known protocols and reporting procedures, in order to increase the quality and quantity of empirical studies in MBT. © 2018 Conferencia Iberoamericana de Software Engineering - CIbSE. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={The course selection has become a favorite issue among the students who pursue their tertiary study in university nowadays. This is because there are a lot of course programmes offered in this knowledge-based education system. Besides that, other factors such as the financial problem, motivation, self-interest, moral support from friends and family are important criteria in the selection of course programmes. The objective 
of this study is to propose a data-driven conceptual framework to determine the student preference in the selection of course programmes with Analytic Hierarchy Process - Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (AHP-TOPSIS) model. Moreover, this study also aims to determine the priority of the decision criteria that influence the selection of course programmes among the students. In this study, the target respondents are the science stream students from Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia who provide the inputs as data-driven decision analysis on the selection of course programmes. The results of this study show that medical science is the most preferred course programmes among the students followed by engineering, science and lastly information system. On the other hand, career prospect has been identified as the most concerned decision criterion by the student in the selection of course programmes. This study is significant because it helps to determine the most preferred course programme as well as the most influential criteria in the selection of course programmes among the students with the proposed conceptual framework based on AHP-TOPSIS model. © Exceling Tech Pub, UK.},

abstract={Software Effort Estimation is key to the success of any project since all downstream activities such as planning, budgeting, developing and Monitoring cannot be executed without clarity on the scope of the activity that needs to be performed. This is a tertiary study that follows 
the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process as put forth by Kitchenham 
in her seminal paper, based on five criteria: estimation technique, estimation accuracy, type of dataset and independent variables used in empirical research on effort estimation. Our study covering 820 Primary Studies through 14 SLRs, shows that Software Effort Estimation studies focus more 
on statistical techniques and Machine Learning is taking precedence in comparison to the others; whereas Expert Judgement is preferred by the industry due to its intuitiveness. There is a need for models that are simple 
to understand and global, due to the distributed nature of software development. The studies are inconclusive about the accuracy benefits of using 
a within company dataset vs.external datasets. Machine learning techniques such FL and GA in combination with Analogy methods generate more accurate estimates. There is increasing consensus on the use of Mean Magnitude of Relative Error (MMRE), Median Magnitude of Relative Error (MdMRE) and Prediction Pred (25%) as the accuracy metric. 78% of the Primary Studies reported accuracy using MMRE. The best MMRE reported is in the range of 7 
to 75. ISBSG (International Software Benchmarking Standards Group) and Desharnais datasets with 27% and 17% usage respectively are the most widely 
used datasets in empirical studies on effort estimation. Fewer than 20 independent variables account for more than 90% impact of variables in empirical analysis on Software effort estimation. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Software product lines are widely used in the software industries to increase the re-usability and to decrease maintenance cost. On the other hand, systematic reviews are widely used in the software engineering research community to provide the overview of the research field and practitioners guidelines. Researchers have conducted many systematic studies on the different aspects of SPLs. To the best of our knowledge, till now there is no tertiary study conducted on systematic studies of SPL related research topics. In this paper, we aim at conducting a systematic mapping study of existing systematic studies to report the overview of the findings for researchers and practitioners. We performed snowballing and automated search to find out the relevant systematic studies. As a result, we analyzed 60 relevant studies to answer 5 research questions. The main focus of this tertiary study is to highlight the research topics, type of published reviews, active researchers and publication forums. Additionally, we highlight some of the limitations of the systematic studies. The 
important finding of this study is that the research field is well matured as the systematic studies covered a wide range of research topics. Another important finding is that many studies provided information for practitioners as well as researchers which is a notable improvement in the systematic reviews. However, many studies failed to assess the quality of the primary studies which is the major limitation of the existing systematic studies. © 2017 ACM.},

The results clearly indicate that the students selected this major on their own, based on their previous experiences in informatics, but that these experiences caused misconceptions rather than creating a true picture of the nature of computer sciences. Based on the analysis of the students' answers, we concluded that they are in great need of institutional support, especially at the beginning of their tertiary studies, to introduce them to computer sciences/informatics. Beyond this, we have revealed another misconception that Software Engineering students tend to focus on the coding aspect of informatics, and especially those who have taken the advanced level school leaving exam are over-confident as regards their programming skills. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Context A number of systematic literature reviews and mapping 
studies (SLRs) covering numerous primary research studies on various aspects of agile software development (ASD) exist. Objective The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the SLRs on ASD research topics for software engineering researchers and practitioners. Method We followed the tertiary study guidelines by Kitchenham et al. to find SLRs published between late 1990s to December 2015. Results We found 28 SLRs focusing on ten different ASD research areas: adoption, methods, practices, human and social aspects, CMMI, usability, global software engineering (GSE), organizational agility, embedded systems, and software product line engineering. The number of SLRs on ASD topics, similar to those on software engineering (SE) topics in general, is on the rise. A majority of the SLRs applied standardized guidelines and the quality of these SLRs on ASD topics was found to be slightly higher for journal publications than for conferences. While some individuals and institutions seem to lead this area, the spread of authors and institutions is wide. With respect to prior review recommendations, significant progress was noticed in the area of connecting agile to established domains such as usability, CMMI, and GSE; and considerable progress was observed in focusing on management-oriented approaches as Scrum and sustaining ASD in different contexts such as embedded systems. Conclusion SLRs of ASD studies are on the rise and cover a variety of ASD aspects, ranging from early adoption issues to newer applications of ASD such as in product line engineering. ASD research can benefit from further primary and secondary studies on evaluating benefits and challenges of ASD methods, agile hybrids in large-scale setups, sustainability, motivation, teamwork, and project management; as well as a fresh review 
of empirical studies in ASD to cover the period post 2008. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Method: We identified 170 secondary studies that were reviewed to answer a set of Research Questions (RQ) related to the practical conduction of secondary studies 
in SE. Results: Results show that both SLRs and SMs have generic RQs, broad search strings, and adopt automatic search as search strategy. However, quality assessment has been more widely adopted in SLRs. Conclusions: In practice, only the quality assessment is conducted differently in SLRs and SMs.},

abstract={In this paper, a decision support system framework is proposed that may be used to assist a tertiary bursary provider during the process of allocating bursaries to prospective students. The system identifies 
those in an initial pool of applicants who are expected to be successful tertiary students, to facilitate final selection from a shortlist of candidates. The working of the system is based on various classification models for predicting whether bursary applicants will be successful in their respective tertiary studies. These model predictions are then combined in 
a weighted fashion to produce a final prediction for each student. In addition, a multi-criteria decision analysis method is used to assign each of the applicants to a ranking level. In this way, the system suggests both a predicted outcome for each candidate and a ranking according to which 
candidates may be compared. The practical working of the system is demonstrated in the context of real data provided by an industry partner, and the success rate of the system’s recommendations is compared with that of the industry partner. © 2017, South African Institute of Industrial Engineering.

abstract={The development of Academic Word List (AWL) has raised awareness on the usefulness of general academic vocabulary among English as second language (ESL) learners especially in expanding their vocabulary size 
as well as constructing strong academic language foundation for their university education. This highlights the relevancy and necessity of AWL embedment into ESL reading materials such as textbooks frequently used by learners in their language studies prior to the start of their tertiary study. In this study, we conducted a corpus-based research on the current English language textbooks used in Malaysian secondary schools in order to inspect whether similar standing on the importance of academic words were 
shared by the authors of the textbooks through the inclusion of the AWL into the textbooks corpus. Using the Range software, the data analysis revealed that 480 (84%) out of 570 AWL words were found in the corpus. However the findings on the frequency of each of the AWL words showed that only 237 (41.6%) word families occurred at least 10 times while the rest consist of 333 word families (58.4%) are found either occurring on average frequency between five to nine times, between one to four times or not found at all in the textbook corpus. These findings indicate the lack of frequency of academic words in the Malaysian English Language Textbooks corpus. Without adequate exposure to academic words, students would not be able to acquire the words fully before the start of their undergraduate studies. Thus, the current textbooks must to be updated to meet the learners’ academic words needs. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

abstract={Context Any newcomer or industrial practitioner is likely to experience difficulties in digesting large volumes of knowledge in software testing. In an ideal world, all knowledge used in industry, education and research should be based on high-quality evidence. Since no decision should be made based on a single study, secondary studies become essential in presenting the evidence. According to our search, over 101 secondary 
studies have been published in the area of software testing since 1994. With this high number of secondary studies, it is important to conduct a review in this area to provide an overview of the research landscape in this area. Objective The goal of this study is to systematically map (classify) the secondary studies in software testing. We propose that tertiary studies can serve as summarizing indexes which facilitate finding the most relevant information from secondary studies and thus supporting evidence-based decision making in any given area of software engineering. Our research questions (RQs) investigate: (1) Software-testing-specific areas, (2) Types of RQs investigated, (3) Numbers and Trends, and (4) Citations of the secondary studies. Method To conduct the tertiary study, we use the systematic-mapping approach. Additionally, we contrast the testing topics to the number of Google hits to address a general popularity of a testing topic and study the most popular papers in terms of citations. We furthermore demonstrate the practicality and usefulness of our results by mapping them to ISTQB foundation syllabus and to SWEBOK to provide implications for practitioners, testing educators, and researchers. Results After 
a systematic search and voting process, our study pool included 101 secondary studies in the area of software testing between 1994 and 2015. Among 
our results are the following: (1) In terms of number of secondary studies, model-based approach is the most popular testing method, web services are the most popular system under test (SUT), while regression testing is 
the most popular testing phase; (2) The quality of secondary studies, as measured by a criteria set established in the community, is slowly increasing as the years go by; and (3) Analysis of research questions, raised and studied in the pool of secondary studies, showed that there is a lack of ‘causality’ and ‘relationship’ type of 
research questions, a situation which needs to be improved if we, as a community, want to advance as a scientific field. (4) Among secondary studies, we found that regular surveys receive significantly more citations than SMs (p = 0.009) and SLRs (p = 0.014). Conclusion Despite the large number of secondary studies, we found that many important areas of software testing currently lack secondary studies, e.g., test management, role of product risk in testing, human factors in software testing, beta-testing (A/B-testing), exploratory testing, testability, test stopping criteria, and test-environment development. Having secondary studies in those areas is important for satisfying industrial and educational needs in software testing. On the other hand, education material of ISTQB foundation syllabus and SWEBOK could benefit from the inclusion of the latest research topics, namely search-based testing, use of cloud-computing for testing and symbolic execution. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={For the past five years, Engineering students from Barcelona School of Civil Engineer in UPC BarcelonaTech have shown that educational 
intervention in first-year engineering programs can positively affect students' awareness of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) concepts by introducing students to basics concepts and motivating them to follow next ones. At Terrassa School of Industrial, Aerospace and Audiovisual Engineering, also belonging to UPC BarcelonaTech, STEM concepts 
are strengthen to high school students by means of the Mercat de Tecnologia, (a science fair among schools) and by some recommended but not compulsory propaedeutic courses of basic subjects, carried out the week prior to the official start of university studies. Still, many students entering 
university show some lacks on theoretical items, particularly those who do not follow the usual way to access to tertiary studies after obligatory 
secondary education but a parallel and more practical one. In fact, there 
is a large heterogeneity in terms of the average previous knowledge of every subject as well as in the individual curriculum of each student, since they might have enrolled different courses before entering the university. Due to those lacks, some professors at both aforementioned schools have developed a MOOC oriented to new university students. The designed MOOC is useful in order to improve the basic knowledge of new students regarding these sciences. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Context: Integrate research evidence with practice is one of the main goals of evidence-based software engineering. However, recent studies show that the connection between systematic reviews and practitioners has not fully established. Goal: This paper presents the first steps towards a medium to transfer knowledge acquired from systematic reviews to 
practitioners. Method: We selected a set of systematic reviews identified 
by a tertiary study and extracted their findings to generate one-page Evidence Briefings to serve as mediums. A design specialist defined the briefings structure based on information design and gestalt principles. To evaluate the format and content of the briefings we conducted personal opinion surveys based on two groups: StackExchange users that posted questions in topics related to the reviews, and the authors of the selected reviews themselves. The former had a response rate of 21.9% (32 out 146) and the latter 31.8% (7 out of 22). Results: Practitioners rarely use systematic review research papers as mediums to acquire knowledge, since just 9% have told to do so. Both researchers and practitioners positively evaluated the evidence briefings, since 71% and 82% of the StackExchange users and systematic review authors, respectively, agreed or strongly agreed that the briefings' interface is clear. Conclusions: Researchers and practitioners were positive about the content and format of the evidence briefings we proposed. It is also possible to say that there is a gap between practitioners and systematic reviews due to the low percentage of practitioners that consume systematic reviews. The good reception of the evidence briefings from both sides show a possible route to reduce that gap. ©

abstract={The growing interest in Agile and Lean software development is reflected in the increasing number of secondary studies on the benefits 
and limitations of Agile and Lean processes and practices. The aim of this tertiary study is to consolidate empirical evidence regarding Agile and 
Lean practices and their respective impacts on project constraints as defined in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK): scope, quality, 
schedule, budget, resources, communication, and risk. In this tertiary study, 13 secondary studies were included for detailed analysis. Given the heterogeneity of the data, we were unable to perform a rigorous synthesis. Instead, we mapped the identified Agile and Lean practices, and their 
impacts on the project constraints described in PMBOK. From 13 secondary studies, we identified 13 Agile and Lean practices. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is studied in ten secondary studies, meanwhile other practices are studied in only one or two secondary studies. This tertiary study provides a consolidated view of the impacts of Agile and Lean practices. The result of this tertiary study indicates that TDD has a positive impact on 
external quality. However, due to insufficient data or contradictory results, we were unable to make inferences on other Agile and Lean practices. 
Implications for research and practice are further discussed in the paper. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Model-driven engineering (MDE) is believed to have a significant impact in software quality. However, researchers and practitioners may have a hard time locating consolidated evidence on this impact, as the available information is scattered in several different publications. Our 
goal is to aggregate consolidated findings on quality in MDE, facilitating the work of researchers and practitioners in learning about the coverage and main findings of existing work as well as identifying relatively unexplored niches of research that need further attention. We performed a tertiary study on quality in MDE, in order to gain a better understanding of its most prominent findings and existing challenges, as reported in the literature. We identified 22 systematic literature reviews and mapping studies and the most relevant quality attributes addressed by each of those studies, in the context of MDE. Maintainability is clearly the most often studied and reported quality attribute impacted by MDE. Eighty out of 
83 research questions in the selected secondary studies have a structure that is more often associated with mapping existing research than with answering more concrete research questions (e.g., comparing two alternative 
MDE approaches with respect to their impact on a specific quality attribute). We briefly outline the main contributions of each of the selected literature reviews. In the collected studies, we observed a broad coverage of software product quality, although frequently accompanied by notes on how much more empirical research is needed to further validate existing claims. Relatively, little attention seems to be devoted to the impact of MDE on the quality in use of products developed using MDE. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Context: The assessment of Threats to Validity (TTVs) is critical to secure the quality of empirical studies in Software Engineering (SE). In the recent decade, Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was becoming an increasingly important empirical research method in SE. One of the mechanisms of insuring the level of scientific value in the findings of an 
SLR is to rigorously assess its validity. Hence, it is necessary to realize the status quo and issues of TTVs of SLRs in SE. Objective: This study 
aims to investigate thestate-of-the-practice of TTVs of the SLRs published in SE, and further support SE researchers to improve the assessment and 
strategies against TTVs in order to increase the quality of SLRs in SE. Method: We conducted a tertiary study by reviewing the SLRs in SE that report the assessment of TTVs. Results: We identified 316 SLRs published from 2004 to the first half of 2015, in which TTVs are discussed. The issues 
associated to TTVs were also summarized and categorized. Conclusion: The common TTVs related to SLR research, such as internal validity and reliability, were thoroughly discussed in most SLRs. The threats to construct validity and external validity drew less attention. Moreover, there are few strategies and tactics being reported to cope with the various TTVs. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Software Process Improvement (SPI) has become one of the main 
strategic objectives in software industry. Companies make more investments in implementing software quality standards and models that focus on process assessment to improve their performance and productivity. To achieve 
these goals, companies focus on improving their process by means of improvement initiatives which may be implemented. To help practitioners find more innovative ways to manage and implement software process improvement initiatives efficiently, an important number of studies related to this topic have been emerged in recent years. Some of them, referred to as secondary studies, focused on the interpretation and synthesis of available published research works by giving an up to date state of art about SPI. This state of the art is provided in a form of literature surveys or in a methodological form using well established approaches such as systematic reviews or systematic mappings or tertiary studies. The objective of this 
paper is to identify and present the current secondary studies on SPI. The purpose is to discuss methods that these literature reviews of SPI use, 
their quality, and specific subjects that they cover. A set of survey research questions have been proposed and discussed through the investigation of 70 selected secondary studies collected from different digital libraries. The results show that success factors and issues related to implementation of SPI initiatives are the most studied, and there is a need to address in depth the measurement aspects in SPI. © 2016 IEEE.},

The purpose of this intervention is to enhance well-being, to help these women get through pregnancy in the best possible way. The intervention will be composed by four modules, for a total length of five weeks. Each module will be dedicated to the promotion of one positive dimension through the use of validated positive psychology exercises. We hypothesize that participants will report a significant higher level of happiness at post-test, and follow-up. Secondly, we hypothesize that participants will report a significant increase in positive affect, optimism, life satisfaction, social support, self-compassion, and psychological well-being, and a reduction in depression, anxiety, and negative affect at post-test and follow-up. Tertiary study objective is to examine if particular subgroups (in term of ages, different week of pregnancy, relationship status, unwanted/wanted pregnancy, and different personality profile) will benefit differently than others from the training. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

One of the methods that has been widely used to support evidence-based practices is the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method. The SLR is a review method that aims to provide unbiased or fair evaluation to existing research evidence. The aim of this study is to gather the trends of evidence-based software engineering (SE) research in Malaysia in particular to identify the usage of SLR method among researchers, academics or practitioners. Based on our tertiary study, we found only 19 published work utilizing evidence-based practices in Malaysia within SE and Computer Science related domains. We have also conducted a survey during SLR workshops for the purpose of gathering perceptions on using SLR. The survey was participated by 78 academics and researchers from five universities in Malaysia. Our findings 
show that researchers in this country are still at preliminary stage in practicing evidence-based approach. We believe that knowledge and skill on 
using SLR should be promoted to encourage more researchers to apply it in

abstract={This paper provides a survey of literature reviews in the area of lot sizing. Its intention is to show which streams of research emerged from Harris' seminal lot size model, and which major achievements have 
been accomplished in the respective areas. We first develop the methodology of this review and then descriptively analyze the sample. Subsequently, a content-related classification scheme for lot sizing models is developed, and the reviews contained in our sample are discussed in light of this classification scheme. Our analysis shows that various extensions of Harris' lot size model were developed over the years, such as lot sizing models that include multi-stage inventory systems, incentives, or productivity issues. The aims of our tertiary study are the following: firstly, it helps primary researchers to position their own work in the literature, 
to reproduce the development of different types of lot sizing problems, and to find starting points if they intend to work in a new research direction. Secondly, the study identifies several topics that offer opportunities for future secondary research. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Abstract Context There is extensive interest in global software development (GSD) which has led to a large number of papers reporting on GSD. A number of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have attempted to aggregate information from individual studies. Objective We wish to investigate GSD SLR research with a focus on discovering what research has been conducted in the area and to determine if the SLRs furnish appropriate risk and risk mitigation advice to provide guidance to organizations involved with GSD. Method We performed a broad automated search to identify 
GSD SLRs. Data extracted from each study included: (1) authors, their affiliation and publishing venue, (2) SLR quality, (3) research focus, (4) GSD risks, (5) risk mitigation strategies and, (6) for each SLR the number 
of primary studies reporting each risk and risk mitigation strategy. Results We found a total of 37 papers reporting 24 unique GSD SLR studies. Major GSD topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, (3) project planning and control and (4) project scope and requirements. We extracted 85 risks and 77 risk mitigation advice items and categorized them under four major headings: outsourcing rationale, software development, human resources, and project management. The largest group of risks was related to project management. GSD outsourcing rationale risks ranked highest in terms of primary study support but in many cases these risks were only identified by a single SLR. Conclusions The focus 
of the GSD SLRs we identified is mapping the research rather than providing evidence-based guidance to industry. Empirical support for the majority of risks identified is moderate to low, both in terms of the number of SLRs identifying the risk, and in the number of primary studies providing 
empirical support. Risk mitigation advice is also limited, and empirical support for these items is low.© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Context. A decade ago, Kitchenham, Dyb and Jørgensen argued that software engineering could benefit from an evidence-based research approach similar that that used in medicine, introducing the basis for 
Evidence Based Software Engineering (EBSE). Objective. Our main goal is to understand the evolution of the use of systematic reviews as the main research method in EBSE, as proposed by Kitchenham et al., by investigating primary and tertiary studies that explore any aspect, theory, or concept around the use of systematic reviews in software engineering. Method. A 
systematic mapping study protocol was used to find and selected studies about EBSE and systematic reviews in SE, published between 2004 and 2013. Results. We selected 52 unique papers classified as non-empirical studies 
(12), empirical studies (31), and tertiary studies (9). Conclusion. SLR has become an important component of software engineering research with nearly 200 unique reviews catalogued by the tertiary studies. Most important limitations are related to the industrial relevance and application of the results of reviews and the poor use of synthesis method to aggregate evidence © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Data is the source as well as raw format of evidence. As an important research methodology in evidence-based software engineering, systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are used for identifying the evidence and critically appraising the evidence, i.e. empirical studies that report 
(empirical) data about specific research questions. The 80/20 Rule (or Pareto's Law) reveals a 'vital few' phenomenon widely observed in many disciplines in the last century. However, the applicability of Pareto's Law to evidence distribution in software engineering (SE) is never tested yet. 
The objective of this paper is to investigate the applicability of Pareto's Law to the evidence distribution on specific topic areas in software engineering (in the form of systematic reviews), which may help us better understand the possible distribution of evidence in software engineering, 
and further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of literature search. We performed a tertiary study of SLRs in software engineering dated between 2004 and 2012. We further tested the Pareto's Law by collecting, analyzing, and interpreting the distribution (over publication venues) of the primary studies reported in the existing SLRs. Our search identified 255 SLRs, 107 of which were included according to the selection criteria. 
The analysis of the extracted data from these SLRs presents a preliminary 
view of the evidence (study) distribution in software engineering. The nonuniform distribution of evidence is supported by the data from the existing SLRs in SE. However, the present observation reflects a weaker 'vital 
few' relation between study and venue than the 80/20 Rule statement. Top referenced venues are suggested when researchers search for studies in software engineering. It is also noticeable to the community that the primary studies are improperly or incompletely reported in many SLRs. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Context: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are a particular type of secondary study used as the main research method in evidence based research and practice. The starting point of a SLR should be a problem from the practice and the results should, somehow, have an impact on improving practice. Objective: To investigate the motivation of software engineering researchers to conduct a SLR and how the results of their reviews are potentially impacting the software engineering practice. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with authors of 120 SLRs published between 2004 and 2010 identified by three tertiary studies previously published. Results: Forty-four authors of SLR participate in the survey. The motivation behind the vast majority of the SLRs was to gather knowledge about a particular field of study. However, only six participants affirmed 
that their reviews actually had a direct impact in industrial practice. Conclusions: The use of SLR has increased over the years but they were mostly focused on academic problems and had very little impact on industrial 
practice. Therefore, the full potential benefits of evidence-based software engineering are not being achieved. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) have gained significant popularity among Software Engineering (SE) researchers since 2004. Several researchers have also been working on improving the scientific and methodological infrastructure to support SLRs in SE. We argue that there is also an apparent and essential need for evidence-based body of 
knowledge about different aspects of the adoption of SLRs in SE. Objective: The main objective of this research is to empirically investigate the adoption, value, and use of SLRs in SE research from various perspectives. Method: We used mixed-methods approach (systematically integrating tertiary literature review, semi-structured interviews and questionnaire-based survey) as it is based on a combination of complementary research methods which are expected to compensate each others' limitations. Results: A large majority of the participants are convinced of the value of using a rigourous and systematic methodology for literature reviews in SE research. However, there are concerns about the required time and resources for SLRs. One of the most important motivators for performing SLRs is new findings and inception of innovative ideas for further research. The reported SLRs are more influential compared to the traditional literature reviews in terms of number of citations. One of the main challenges of conducting SLRs is drawing a balance between methodological rigour and required 
effort. Conclusions: SLR has become a popular research methodology for conducting literature review and evidence aggregation in SE. There is an overall positive perception about this relatively new methodology to SE research. The findings provide interesting insights into different aspects of SLRs. We expect that the findings can provide valuable information to readers about what can be expected from conducting SLRs and the potential impact of such reviews. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Public education records were investigated to obtain post hoc enrolment data to establish trends and decline in enrolments in physics and chemistry in the final years of high school which revealed a trend in enrolments falling over a ten year period. The student population in science of physics and chemistry were not well prepared for future studies and are a challenge for students undertaking engineering and technology studies at a tertiary level. It is proposed that primary and high school science subjects be made more popular by integrating popular aspects of materials in everyday life, so making science an appealing part of the 
syllabus. Initiating these syllabus changes will enhance the way science subjects are taught to encourage studies into engineering.},

In particular, we observe current trends in the software engineering research and perform an investigation of the role of agile topics in the GSE research literature. Our findings indicate that agility is one of the topics attracting attention in the research agenda for global software companies. In contrast to recent beliefs 
that agile and distributed are two incompatibilities Global Agile development becomes more and more accepted, a trend which we also see from the growing amount of research on GSE and agile. Finally we conclude that there are indications that both globalization and "agilization" of software companies are stable trends for the future but that there is a strong need 
for further studies on the particular challenges that distribution of work imposes on the principles of agile development. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Context: Comparing and contrasting evidence from multiple studies is necessary to build knowledge and reach conclusions about the empirical support for a phenomenon. Therefore, research synthesis is at the center of the scientific enterprise in the software engineering discipline. Objective: The objective of this article is to contribute to a better 
understanding of the challenges in synthesizing software engineering research and their implications for the progress of research and practice. Method: A tertiary study of journal articles and full proceedings papers from the inception of evidence-based software engineering was performed to assess the types and methods of research synthesis in systematic reviews in software engineering. Results: As many as half of the 49 reviews included in the study did not contain any synthesis. Of the studies that did contain synthesis, two thirds performed a narrative or a thematic synthesis. Only a few studies adequately demonstrated a robust, academic approach 
to research synthesis. Conclusion: We concluded that, despite the focus on systematic reviews, there is limited attention paid to research synthesis in software engineering. This trend needs to change and a repertoire of synthesis methods needs to be an integral part of systematic reviews to 
increase their significance and utility for research and practice. ©

abstract={Context: Since the introduction of evidence-based software engineering in 2004, systematic literature review (SLR) has been increasingly used as a method for conducting secondary studies in software engineering. Two tertiary studies, published in 2009 and 2010, identified and analysed 54 SLRs published in journals and conferences in the period between 
1st January 2004 and 30th June 2008. Objective: In this article, our goal 
was to extend and update the two previous tertiary studies to cover the period between 1st July 2008 and 31st December 2009. We analysed the quality, coverage of software engineering topics, and potential impact of published SLRs for education and practice. Method: We performed automatic and 
manual searches for SLRs published in journals and conference proceedings, analysed the relevant studies, and compared and integrated our findings 
with the two previous tertiary studies. Results: We found 67 new SLRs addressing 24 software engineering topics. Among these studies, 15 were considered relevant to the undergraduate educational curriculum, and 40 appeared of possible interest to practitioners. We found that the number of SLRs in software engineering is increasing, the overall quality of the studies is improving, and the number of researchers and research organisations worldwide that are conducting SLRs is also increasing and spreading. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the software engineering research community is starting to adopt SLRs consistently as a research method. However, the majority of the SLRs did not evaluate the quality of primary studies and fail to provide guidelines for practitioners, thus decreasing their potential impact on software engineering practice. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The Engineering faculty at the University of KwaZulu Natal has a rich diversity of students ranging from differing academic abilities and secondary school experiences. Research has revealed that many first year students are often under-prepared for tertiary study because they have not yet developed the abstract reasoning skills that allow them to learn new ideas simply by reading a text or listening to a lecture. These skills are important to engineering education because engineering schools are supposedly preparing students who as professional engineers, will be required to work in self-directed ways through problem solving and collaborative team work. This paper therefore reflects selected findings of a study undertaken at a University in KwaZulu Natal which explored student engagement in Supplemental Instruction (SI) sessions in first year chemistry 
for engineers. SI is a student academic assistance programme providing regularly scheduled sessions for high risk courses. The special focus of this paper is to explore how SI leaders create opportunities during SI sessions to develop critical thinking skills with first year Engineering students. The central question guiding this paper is: How does SI leader intervention enhance first year engineering students' critical thinking skills in Chemistry learning? Data was collected using a design research methodology where the main data generation methods were video-recordings and observations of SI sessions and focus group interviews with students. Data 
was analysed within an Interpretative paradigm using engagement theory as 
an analytical framework within a context of a phenomenon of social learning space. Data analysis revealed that SI leaders encouraged engagement through motivation of students, by creating spaces for higher-order questions, engaging in activities that required higher-order thinking and encouraged students to reflect on concepts learnt. It is therefore argued that the social learning spaces created during the SI intervention session have the potential to develop meaningful learners in chemistry with independent lifelong learning skills.

abstract={Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are a major tool for supporting evidence-based software engineering. Adapting the procedures involved in such a review to meet the needs of software engineering and its literature remains an ongoing process. As part of this process of refinement, we undertook two case studies which aimed 1) to compare the use of targeted manual searches with broad automated searches and 2) to compare different methods of reaching a consensus on quality. For Case 1, we compared a tertiary study of systematic literature reviews published between January 1, 2004 and June 30, 2007 which used a manual search of selected journals and conferences and a replication of that study based on a broad automated search. We found that broad automated searches find more studies 
than manual restricted searches, but they may be of poor quality. Researchers undertaking SLRs may be justified in using targeted manual searches if they intend to omit low quality papers, or they are assessing research 
trends in research methodologies. For Case 2, we analyzed the process used to evaluate the quality of SLRs. We conclude that if quality evaluation 
of primary studies is a critical component of a specific SLR, assessments 
should be based on three independent evaluators incorporating at least two rounds of discussion. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs published in the time period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2008. We contrast the number, quality and source of these SLRs with SLRs found in the original study. 
Results: Our broad search found an additional 35 SLRs corresponding to 33 
unique studies. Of these papers, 17 appeared relevant to the undergraduate educational curriculum and 12 appeared of possible interest to practitioners. The number of SLRs being published is increasing. The quality of papers in conferences and workshops has improved as more researchers use SLR guidelines.

In this study, students' academic performance in assessments across a range of science disciplines during the first half of their first semester was compared with performance in the final examinations. In all cases poor correlations were observed. It appears that in-semester academic performance is, by itself, not an effective means of identifying students at risk of failing.},

The sample allows for an empirical analysis of the variables that potentially influence students in choosing a particular private university. Factor analysis was used to group the variables into several dimensions or factors. The results show that institutional and economic factors such as quality education, job oriented subjects, physical environment and tuition fees were significant in influencing the choice variables, while technical factors such as advertisements, logistics and peer group influences were found to be less influential.

Aims: This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 
10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven 
SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas 
covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Some students who have achieved well at high school struggle with their tertiary studies, in spite of frequently reporting considerable study times. We hypothesize that these students misunderstand some of the underlying key concepts. In order to remedy these misunderstandings, and to provide students with appropriate learning experiences, it is important to establish the extent to which students do actually grasp the relevant concepts. To achieve these goals, we must first determine the core concepts associated with our courses, then use diagnostic tests to reveal the student misunderstandings. Given the current prevalence of large class sizes and high instructor workloads, an automated assessment system is to be preferred where possible. A web-based system, called OASIS, was developed to deliver, mark and analyse concept-based diagnostic tests. Produced in-house, OASIS can deliver a test of core concepts and provide instructors with a quantitative measure of the level of class understanding over a range of these core concepts. Additionally, the software can be used 
throughout the course to provide students with opportunities to practise their problem-solving skills. This paper describes the development of a concept inventory in engineering electromagnetics and the software used to 
deliver diagnostic tests based on the inventory.},

one of a range of initiatives to significantly lift enrolments in tertiary study in technology, engineering and science over the medium to long-term. Begun in 2003, Futureintech is an initiative of The Institution of Professional Engineers, New Zealand. Futureintech works directly with schools and industries to help ensure that technology, maths and science teachers have the right resources to inform students and inspire them to continue their study through to tertiary level. The approach is hands-on. Nine 
Facilitators work to engage industry support, and work with classroom teachers, careers advisors, students and their caregivers, within primary, intermediate and secondary schools throughout New Zealand. Futureintech Ambassadors play a major role as industry role models. Ambassadors are young technologists, scientists, and engineers who are trained as volunteers to work in classrooms alongside teachers and students to support the curriculum. Currently 235 are involved in a variety of initiatives throughout 
the country, assisting with projects, helping students work towards national qualifications, facilitating individual and class access to workplaces and offering personal contributions to career evenings. Futureintech works in close partnership with a wide range of organisations including the 
Royal Society of New Zealand, the New Zealand Institute of Food Science and Technology, and the New Zealand Computer Society and helps co-ordinate 
and promote science and technology-based educational schemes such as CREST, Bright Sparks and the Transpower Neighbourhood Engineers Awards. Futureintech Ambassadors mentor students involved in these projects, offering them an industry perspective. Futureintech also strongly supports Ministry of Education initiatives in the field, particularly the Growth and Innovation Framework Technology Education initiative to promote and support technology education at senior secondary. In Futureintech's Visiting Industry Professionals (VIP) Scheme, technology, engineering and science professionals are hosted by a university or polytechnic for up to three weeks. 
The aim of the Scheme is to encourage ongoing partnerships between tertiary institutions and technology-based industries, and to raise awareness of specific industry environments, areas of growth and career opportunities. Futureintech's website, www.futureintech.org.nz, is a key promotional tool for careers in technology, engineering and science, and a resource base for teachers, careers advisors, caregivers and students. Futureintech 
has also published a range of promotional material, including booklets targeting caregivers, and posters and brochures for classroom use, and regularly contributes articles to youth magazines, community newspapers and other media. The Project is monitored and evaluated by researchers at the University of Auckland and anecdotal evidence to date strongly suggests that the Project's approach is successful. All respondents rated Futureintech positively as a general initiative for supporting careers in technology, engineering and science in New Zealand. Monitoring and evaluation is in its final phase and will focus on continuing to gain a mix of quantitative and qualitative data from a range of sources to establish the impact 
of Futureintech within different sectors. The remaining three months will 
also focus on collecting post intervention data from case study schools. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Females are under-represented in education, training and employment in the area of Information Communication Technology (ICT). Research shows that girls are tuning out to ICTs in school and they have a tow participation rate in ICT related tertiary study and employment. The Tech Savvy report by the American Association of University Women (2000) suggests "they are not so much phobic but are disenchanted". This paper discusses a case study which is attempting to increase ICT skills and self confidence in a small group of female students through mentoring and increased access to ICT tools. It also considers whether isolated projects such as this one are attempts in first aide rather than radical surgery to ensure that females are not left behind in the digital revolution (Green, 2003).},

abstract={The global economy with its ever shifting employment patterns 
has led to an increasing emphasis on tertiary education in terms of the process of 'life long learning1 in order to create a flexible market of educational services. This factor combined with the ever-increasing expansion of information and communication technologies (ICT) is likely to create a rich learning environment However, because of the lack of both knowledge and skills, and culture in the field of using ICT effectively, technologies are not used to their fullest potential. Ample opportunities, combined with skills of independent studies create possibilities for learning 
environment, where every individual both contributes, and benefits in a process of life long learning. The aim of this presentation is both to analyse features of learning in a contemporary society, and learning environments that can be used in order to facilitate learning in tertiary education. Results of the research that included literature analysis, quantitative (questionnaires) research and the qualitative (interviews) research: reflections on experiences of the authors are presented together with conclusions, which emphasize the role of people and their commitments in developing learning environments.},
