abstract = {Context: The quality of an Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is as good as the quality of the reviewed papers. Hence, it is vital to rigorously assess the papers included in an SLR. There has been no tertiary study aimed at reporting the state of the practice of quality assessment used in SLRs in Software Engineering (SE).Objective: We aimed to study the practices of quality assessment of the papers included in SLRs in SE.Method: We conducted a tertiary study of the SLRs that have performed quality assessment of the reviewed papers.Results: We identified and analyzed different aspects of the quality assessment of the papers included in 127 SLRs.Conclusion: Researchers use a variety of strategies for quality assessment of the papers reviewed, but report little about the justification for the used criteria. The focus is creditability but not relevance 
aspect of the papers. Appropriate guidelines are required for devising quality assessment strategies.},

abstract = {Context: In the last years, diverse research areas increased their interest in Grey Literature (GL). In Software Engineering (SE), SE practitioners became heavy consumers of GL, by way of contrast to traditional research papers. Problem: This is unfortunate, in particular, although the increase of Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) published, researchers, claim to the lack of them of connection to the practice. Goal: Propose and evaluate a set of guidelines to help SE researchers to conduct a Grey Literature Review (GLR) that are more in line with practitioners' needs. Method: First, we are conducting a tertiary study to understand how secondary studies use GL. Second, we plan to employ qualitative research with researchers of SLRs and SE practitioners. Third, we plan to review 
and analyze the use of GL source according to the context in SE. Fourth, we plan to conduct a GLR. Finally, we plan to perform and evaluate our guideline. Preliminary Results: The tertiary study retrieved a total of 14,043 papers. We removed the duplicate studies and also which were not peer-reviewed articles. Currently, we are solving the conflicts of disagreement of the selection process. Conclusions: We present preliminary findings, show our proposed approach and the next steps.},

abstract = {Software product lines are widely used in the software industries to increase the re-usability and to decrease maintenance cost. On the other hand, systematic reviews are widely used in the software engineering research community to provide the overview of the research field and practitioners guidelines. Researchers have conducted many systematic studies on the different aspects of SPLs. To the best of our knowledge, till now there is no tertiary study conducted on systematic studies of SPL related research topics. In this paper, we aim at conducting a systematic mapping study of existing systematic studies to report the overview of the findings for researchers and practitioners. We performed snowballing and automated search to find out the relevant systematic studies. As a result, we analyzed 60 relevant studies to answer 5 research questions. The main focus of this tertiary study is to highlight the research topics, type of published reviews, active researchers and publication forums. Additionally, we highlight some of the limitations of the systematic studies. The important finding of this study is that the research field is well matured as the systematic studies covered a wide range of research topics. Another important finding is that many studies provided information for practitioners as well as researchers which is a notable improvement in the systematic reviews. However, many studies failed to assess the quality of 
the primary studies which is the major limitation of the existing systematic studies.},

to efficiently manage the knowledge generated. Agile practices can benefit the software organizations in terms of KM. Some studies have already presented evidence about this relationship. However, the intersection of these two areas still require further more clarification. Objective: This study aims to synthesize research on KM and Agile Software Development (ASD) using the meta-ethnography method. Method: In order to achieve the proposed goal, first, we applied the seven phases of meta-ethnography analysis method on a five articles selected from a tertiary study on KM and ASD. Second, the relations identified between the areas investigated were analysed from interviews with three agile development methodology experts. Results: A relation map that summarizes the synthesis identified between KM, agile values and scrum activities was created. Conclusion: There is a significant contribution in KM and ASD for both software engineering 
academics and industry.},

abstract = {The Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) is a measure of a student's overall pre-tertiary academic achievement. For most tertiary degree programs across Australia, the selection of year 12 domestic applicants is based on an ATAR, on the premise that selection based on a student's overall academic achievement prior to university is a predictor of success for tertiary study. This paper is an empirical analysis into whether the ATAR and prior study in programming or mathematics can be used to predict student success in an Information and Communication Technology 
(ICT) degree. Our study has four key findings: the ATAR is not a significant indicator that a student will graduate on schedule from our ICT degree; the ATAR can be used as significant indicator that a student will successfully complete the first year of our ICT degree; the ATAR can be used as a significant indicator that a student will successfully complete our first-year introductory programming course; and finally, prior learning of ICT-related material is not a significant indicator of whether a student will pass or fail our introductory programming course on their first attempt.},

abstract = {Context: Systematic literature reviews and mapping studies usually rely on automated searches of digital libraries to identify primary studies. Defining proper search strings, executing semantically similar searches on different libraries, and reporting limitations of searches increase the reliability of secondary studies. Objective: We aim to survey the current state of using automated searches in secondary software engineering studies. In particular, we aim at analyzing how automated searches are reported and at understanding the reproducibility of secondary studies. Method: We perform a preliminary tertiary study that covers 50 recently published representative secondary studies from different software engineering venues and subfields. Results: We found that most secondary studies complement an automated search with a manual search and use four or 
more digital libraries. Also, we found that the quality of reporting search strings is rather poor. Finally, we found that most secondary studies do not acknowledge limitations of automated searches and implications of limitations on study findings. Conclusions: Our findings highlight implications for researchers (e.g., to properly report the search process) and for reviewers (e.g., to execute search strings reported in papers). Also, 
our findings indicate that secondary studies are difficult to replicate.},

abstract = {Context: Data synthesis is one of the most significant tasks in Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Software Engineering (SE) researchers have adopted a variety of methods of synthesizing data that originated in other disciplines. One of the qualitative data synthesis methods is meta-ethnography, which is being used in SE SLRs. Objective: We aim at studying the adoption of meta-ethnography in SE SLRs in order to understand how this method has been used in SE. Method: We conducted a tertiary study of the use of meta-ethnography by reviewing sixteen SLRs. We carried 
out an empirical inquiry by integrating SLR and confirmatory email survey. Results: There is a general lack of knowledge, or even awareness, of different aspects of meta-ethnography and/or how to apply it. Conclusion: 
There is a need of investment in gaining in-depth knowledge and skills of 
correctly applying meta-ethnography in order to increase the quality and reliability of the findings generated from SE SLRs. Our study reveals that meta-ethnography is a suitable method to SE research. We discuss challenges and propose recommendations of adopting meta-ethnography in SE. Our effort also offers a preliminary checklist of the systematic considerations for doing meta-ethnography in SE and improving the quality of meta-ethnographic research in SE.},

Studies that have used the SLR research methodology in software engineering and have implicitly or explicitly reported their experiences are included in this review. Results: Our research has revealed 116 studies relevant to the theme. The data has been extracted by two researchers working independently and conflicts resolved after discussion with third researcher. Findings from these studies highlight Search Strategy, Online Databases, Planning and Data Extraction as the most challenging phases of SLR. Lack of standard terminology in software engineering papers, poor quality of abstracts and problems with search engines are some of the most cited challenges. Conclusion: Further research and guidelines is required to facilitate novice researchers in conducting these phases properly.},

abstract = {Context: Integrate research evidence with practice is one of the main goals of evidence-based software engineering. However, recent studies show that the connection between systematic reviews and practitioners has not fully established.Goal: This paper presents the first steps towards a medium to transfer knowledge acquired from systematic reviews to practitioners.Method: We selected a set of systematic reviews identified by a tertiary study and extracted their findings to generate one-page Evidence Briefings to serve as mediums. A design specialist defined the briefings structure based on information design and gestalt principles. To evaluate the format and content of the briefings we conducted personal opinion surveys based on two groups: StackExchange users that posted questions in topics related to the reviews, and the authors of the selected reviews themselves. The former had a response rate of 21.9% (32 out 146) and 
the latter 31.8% (7 out of 22).Results: Practitioners rarely use systematic review research papers as mediums to acquire knowledge, since just 9% have told to do so. Both researchers and practitioners positively evaluated the evidence briefings, since 71% and 82% of the StackExchange users and systematic review authors, respectively, agreed or strongly agreed that the briefings' interface is clear.Conclusions: Researchers and practitioners were positive about the content and format of the evidence briefings we proposed. It is also possible to say that there is a gap between practitioners and systematic reviews due to the low percentage of practitioners that consume systematic reviews. The good reception of the evidence briefings from both sides show a possible route to reduce that gap.},

abstract = { Data is the source as well as raw format of evidence. As an important research methodology in evidence-based software engineering, systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are used for identifying the evidence and critically appraising the evidence, i.e. empirical studies that report (empirical) data about specific research questions. The 80/20 Rule (or Pareto's Law) reveals a 'vital few' phenomenon widely observed in many disciplines in the last century. However, the applicability of Pareto's Law to evidence distribution in software engineering (SE) is never tested yet. The objective of this paper is to investigate the applicability of Pareto's Law to the evidence distribution on specific topic areas in software engineering (in the form of systematic reviews), which may help us better understand the possible distribution of evidence in software engineering, and further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of literature search. We performed a tertiary study of SLRs in software engineering dated between 2004 and 2012. We further tested the Pareto's Law by collecting, analyzing, and interpreting the distribution (over publication venues) 
of the primary studies reported in the existing SLRs. Our search identified 255 SLRs, 107 of which were included according to the selection criteria. The analysis of the extracted data from these SLRs presents a preliminary view of the evidence (study) distribution in software engineering. The nonuniform distribution of evidence is supported by the data from the existing SLRs in SE. However, the present observation reflects a weaker 'vital few' relation between study and venue than the 80/20 Rule statement. Top referenced venues are suggested when researchers search for studies in software engineering. It is also noticeable to the community that the primary studies are improperly or incompletely reported in many SLRs. },
